From the 79 plus trees 6 superior female trees were identified and selected. The performance of these 6 female trees was assessed at two research centers and also in farmer’s field. It was found that female tree No. 20 was performing very well followed by female tree No. 71 and 176. The volume gained by Tree No. 20 was 30% higher than the other trees. Recommendation Therefore propagules of the female trees clone No. 20, 71 and 176 are recommended for any further planting program. SANDAL RAISING TECHNOLOGY IN DIFFERENT HOST SPECIES Sandal with stylo scabra The experiment has been taken up to find out the techniques of raising of Sandal plantations under rain-fed conditions, through broadcasting of sandal seeds with appropriate host that could be of fodder value and also could grow under rain-fed conditions. Some non-conventional host species such as Stylo scabra, Ordinary grass, Cajanus cajans, Sorghum vulgare, Casuarina junghuniana, Manihot esculents (Tapioca), Moringa oliefera (Annual drumstick), Desmanthus varigatus (Velimasal), Muntanjea calabra (Singapore cherry were tried.   The following hosts are found to be best for these locations. 1 Seshanchavady Stylo scabra, Casuarina junghuniana 2 Lokkur C. junghuniana, Stylo scabra 3 Kurumbapatti C. junghuniana, Moringa olifera 4 Gobachamdram Stylo scabra, Cajanus 5 Ramanahalli Sorgum vulgare, Stylo scabra 6 SFRI, Vandalur Stylo scabra, Casuarina junghuniana   STUDY ON PHYTO-REMEDIATION SELECTION OF SPECIES FOR SEWAGE WATER RECLAMATION In the year 1999-2000 about 39 economically important species including Bamboo and Canes were chosen based on their efficiency in problem soils and planted for finding out the most suitable species that could perform better when sewage water was used for irrigation. They were planted at 3x3m espacement in 1m3 pits along with bio nutrients and bio fertilizers. Recommendation The following species were recommended for growing, under sewage water for ensuring mitigation of malady and also to get assured economic gains.
