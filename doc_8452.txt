Many households obtain access to electricity through illegal connections, which can be unsafe and contribute to commercial distribution losses at utilities. To address this challenge, the Indian electricity act of 2003 introduced a provision to increase formal access by requiring electric utilities to connect and supply any customer who can provide proof of residency. In 2009, the global partnership on output-based aid (GPOBA) approved a pilot project for 1.652 million dollars with the objective of increasing access to safe electricity supply in Indian slums through targeted output-based subsides. The pilot focused on selected urban slum areas of Mumbai, but had potential for scale-up in other communities in Mumbai and across India if successfully implemented. The project was implemented by Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RIL), a private sector utility, and the sole distributor of electricity in the suburbs of Mumbai.</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=000442464_20141208105634&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-08T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-08T05:00:00.000ZHousing & Human Habitats|Energy Production and Transportation|Urban Water Supply and Sanitation|E-Business|Urban Governance and ManagementEnergy|Water Supply and Sanitation|Urban Development|Communities and Human Settlements|Private Sector DevelopmentIndiaSouth AsiaEnglishChallenges in formalizing the supply of electricity in Mumbai's slumsBriefEnglishSouth AsiaHousing & Human Habitats|Energy Production and Transportation|Urban Water Supply and Sanitation|E-Business|Urban Governance and ManagementEnergy|Water Supply and Sanitation|Urban Development|Communities and Human Settlements|Private Sector DevelopmentIndiaIntegrated Safeguards Data Sheet (Concept Stage) - MSME Growth Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project - P151544</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=090224b0828f3965_1_0&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-08T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-08T05:00:00.000ZIndiaEnglishIntegrated Safeguards Data Sheet (Concept Stage) - MSME Growth Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project - P151544Integrated Safeguards Data SheetEnglishIndiaIntegrated Safeguards Data Sheet (Appraisal Stage) - IN: CITIZEN ACCESS TO RESPONSIVE SERVICES â âSARV SEVAâ PROJECT - P149182</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=090224b0828ec0c7_1_0&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-07T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-07T05:00:00.000ZIndiaEnglishIntegrated Safeguards Data Sheet (Appraisal Stage) - IN: CITIZEN ACCESS TO RESPONSIVE SERVICES â âSARV SEVAâ PROJECT - P149182Integrated Safeguards Data SheetEnglishIndiaBarriers to household risk management : evidence from IndiaWhy do many households remain exposed to large exogenous sources of nonsystematic income risk? We use a series of randomized field experiments in rural India to test the importance of price and non-price factors in the adoption of an innovative rainfall insurance product. Demand is significantly price sensitive, but widespread take-up would not be achieved even if the product offered a payout ratio comparable to US insurance contracts. The authors present evidence suggesting that lack of trust, liquidity constraints, and limited salience are significant non-price frictions that constrain demand. The authors suggest possible contract design improvements to mitigate these frictions.</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=000333037_20141205034206&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-05T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-05T05:00:00.000ZFinancial Literacy|Debt Markets|Emerging Markets|Labor Policies|Financial IntermediationSocial Protections and Labor|Finance and Financial Sector Development|Private Sector DevelopmentIndiaSouth AsiaEnglishBarriers to household risk management : evidence from IndiaJournal ArticleEnglishSouth AsiaFinancial Literacy|Debt Markets|Emerging Markets|Labor Policies|Financial IntermediationSocial Protections and Labor|Finance and Financial Sector Development|Private Sector DevelopmentIndiaTribal development plan</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=000371432_20141205152441&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-05T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-05T05:00:00.000ZGovernance Indicators|Public Sector Corruption & Anticorruption Measures|National Governance|Population Policies|Housing & Human HabitatsGovernance|Public Sector Development|Health, Nutrition and Population|Communities and Human SettlementsIndiaSouth AsiaEnglishTribal development planIndigenous Peoples PlanEnglishSouth AsiaGovernance Indicators|Public Sector Corruption & Anticorruption Measures|National Governance|Population Policies|Housing & Human HabitatsGovernance|Public Sector Development|Health, Nutrition and Population|Communities and Human SettlementsIndiaIndia - Karnataka Municipal Reform Project : P079675 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 19</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=090224b0828e7fdb_1_0&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-05T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-05T05:00:00.000ZIndiaEnglishIndia - Karnataka Municipal Reform Project : P079675 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 19Implementation Status and Results ReportEnglishIndiaOfficial Documents- Letter Agreement for Extension of Closing Date for TF012765</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=090224b0828e787f_1_0&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-05T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-05T05:00:00.000ZIndiaEnglishOfficial Documents- Letter Agreement for Extension of Closing Date for TF012765AgreementEnglishIndiaIndia - Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development II Project : P131235 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 02</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=090224b0828e4a07_1_0&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-04T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-04T05:00:00.000ZIndiaEnglishIndia - Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development II Project : P131235 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 02Implementation Status and Results ReportEnglishIndiaProject Information Document (Appraisal Stage) - IN: CITIZEN ACCESS TO RESPONSIVE SERVICES â âSARV SEVAâ PROJECT - P149182</div><img src="http://wbws.worldbank.org/feeds/main/tracker.html?p=090224b0828e0356_1_0&db=doc&feedName=in_all&feedClass=COU&cid=3001_77" height=1 width=1 border=0></div>2014-12-04T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-04T05:00:00.000ZIndiaEnglishProject Information Document (Appraisal Stage) - IN: CITIZEN ACCESS TO RESPONSIVE SERVICES â âSARV SEVAâ PROJECT - P149182Project Information DocumentEnglishIndiaThe project MSME Growth Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project is now in the pipeline.<p>The project MSME Growth Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project is now in the pipeline.

It leverages financing from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) in the amount of US$ 100 million that follows on from DPL 1 which was approved by the Board on September 6, 2012 in the amount of $100 million financed through IBRD. The program of DPL 1 and 2 are designed to help GoHP to develop a framework which, if followed, should ensure that energy generation is greener, the dependence on fossil fuels is lower and the impacts on the environment and people are much reduced. This program will assist GoHP in transformative actions in sectors that are key engines of growth (i.e. energy, industry and tourism). These transformative actions include policy reforms and institutional reforms based on the piloting of innovative practices. DPL 2 will be the second and concluding part of the programmatic series following the IBRD-provided budgetary support of US$ 100 million, which is presently being implemented. India's remarkable growth record has been constrained by a degrading environment and growing scarcity of natural resources. Mirroring the size and diversity of its economy, environmental risks are wide ranging and are driven by both poverty and prosperity. Much of the burden of growth and development is falling upon the country's natural assets and its people. Environmental sustainability could become the next major challenge as India surges along its growth trajectory.2014-12-02T05:00:00.000Z2014-12-02T05:00:00.000ZIndiaP143032INClosedCHANGEThe project IN Bihar Flood Management Information System Phase II has changed to Closed<p>The project IN Bihar Flood Management Information System Phase II has changed to Closed.

There are five components to the project, the first component being value chain development. The objective of this component is to increase the income of 250,000 small and marginal farmers by at least 50 percent through productivity enhancement and improved market access. This component will work with those small and marginal producers who have built up productive assets, have previously participated in productivity improvement, and have the potential to exploit growth opportunities for high value commodities such as red gram, milk, poultry, small ruminants, fisheries, turmeric, cashew, and coffee. The second component is the human development. This project takes a very innovative approach towards human development, which is very different from the work previously done by SERP in this area and focuses on convergence with the line departments. The third component is the access to social protection services and entitlements. As a complement to the Government of Andhra Pradesh program to strengthen technology enabled services, this component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to 500,000 of the poorest households. This component will be in alignment with the roll out strategies of the respective line departments that are responsible for those entitlements. The fourth component is the mission support, ICT and partnerships. This component will support the missions recently launched by the government to ensure real time analytics, open data systems and feedback-based policy development at the state level. Finally, the fifth component is the project implementation support. The objective of this component is to strengthen the project implementation. It will finance dedicated staffing for the project activities, consultancies, training and related material, office equipment, and operational costs.2014-09-19T04:00:00.000Z2014-09-19T04:00:00.000ZIndiaP152210INNEW RELEASENEWThe project TA to Enhance Financial Access through Technology in Andhra Pradesh, India has changed to Closed<p>The project TA to Enhance Financial Access through Technology in Andhra Pradesh, India has changed to Closed.

The additional loan will support additional transmission investments initiated under the ongoing PSDP-IV to scale-up the project's impact and development effectiveness. The schemes to be financed have been selected based on least-cost technical and economic criteria with adequate social and environmental safeguards. The project is expected to have a positive development impact in terms of expanding the transmission system and capacity, reducing transmission losses and the consequent reduction in cost of energy. In addition, it will contribute to the clean energy initiative through both the ability to transfer surplus hydro energy to power deficit regions in India and the avoidance of building generation facilities.2014-08-03T04:00:00.000Z2014-08-03T04:00:00.000ZIndiaP112798INClosedCHANGEThe project POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IV has changed to Closed<p>The project POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IV has changed to Closed.

The project consists of only one project component, namely Transmission System Strengthening Schemes. The proposal is to include one new scheme (System Strengthening XIII in Southern Regional Grid, SRSS 13) under the project component (PSDP IV). This scheme is over and above the schemes that were agreed during the project appraisal. Since disbursements have already been made against the schemes, these disbursements need to be made retroactively eligible from January 1, 2012. The new scheme to be financed has been selected based on the least-cost technical and economic criteria with appropriate social and environment safeguards. The project implementation plan (PIP) for this scheme has been approved by the Bank. The due diligence for the scheme proposed to be shifted from PSDP V was done earlier at the time of project appraisal in late 2009. The scheme did not see any major implementation issues. This scheme is targeted for completion in May 2014.2014-08-03T04:00:00.000Z2014-08-03T04:00:00.000ZIndiaP101653INClosedCHANGEThe project India Development Marketplace 2014 is now in the pipeline.<p>The project India Development Marketplace 2014 is now in the pipeline.
