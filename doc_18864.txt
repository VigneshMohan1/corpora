This system helps the authorities to allot House Rent Allowance (HRA) to the employees of the public sector, posted in different cities across the country. Following the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission of 2008, the cities are categorised under sections X, Y and Z. The Union Cabinet of India had established the 6th CPC on 5 October 2006 with the objective to edit and hike up the salaries of the public servants, serving the central government. Formerly, the division was made on the grounds of Compensatory City Allowance (CCA) and HRA. However, after CPC 2008, the population of the city has been set as the criteria for the segregation. As per the changes, A-1 has been renamed as X, while A, B-1 & B-2 as Y, and C & uncategorised cities as Z. The better known term for the categories is Tier-I, Tier-II and Tier-III cities, respectively. As per media reports, there are about 8 Tier I cities, 26 Tier II cities, 33 Tier III cities and over 5,000 Tier IV towns, while there are more than 638,000 villages in the country.
