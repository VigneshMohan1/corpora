Established in November 1995, the NIANP, Bengalooru has carved out a prominent place in the NARS system with its substantial contribution s in the field of animal nutrition and physiology, more particularly towards productivity enhancement for profitable and sustainable livestock production, improving production efficiency of livestock through basic physiological and nutr itional approaches.  Though the Institute is mandated to conduct basic and fundamental research, yet the Institute has appreciatingly contributed at farm gate level also with several of its innovative research findings, which has helped the Institute in making its own mark and become well-known among not only the animal husbandry practitioners, but also the feed industry sector.The Institute has also spread the knowledge gained among quite a large number of academicians, researchers and extension workers by organizing several training programmes, Winter and Summer Schools, Workshops etc. In recent years, buoyed by its success, the Institute has diversified its research activities by taking up several futuristic projects , such as metagenomic, proteomic and nanotechnology methods to enhance nutrient availability and utilization, augment reproductive efficiency, facilitate adaptation strategies in the wake of climate change, need for food security, long-term sustainability of growth etc.  I am confident that with the presence of qualified and well-trained human resource, availability of infrastructure facilities and laboratories with state of art equipments, the Institute will be able to meet the needs of the time.
