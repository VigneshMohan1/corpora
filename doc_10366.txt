Offers hydroponic solutions for urban India Manikandan Pattabiraman Geekgardener Greentech manufactures hydroponic kits and customized systems along with gardening materials and accessories. It was established in July 2012 in Bangalore, India, by Mr. Manikandan Pattabiraman and Mr. Roxy Philip. As both the founders shared passion for modern agriculture, especially the hydroponics, they decided to join hands and work together. Mr. Pattabiraman, MD of the company, shares, “Back then there was little resource in India with respect to urban agriculture and hydroponics. It triggered us to set up the company.” The duo worked on numerous designs since 2006 before entering the market. Also, they themselves grew almost all the vegetables in their test greenhouse to ensure they delivered a kit efficient to use. The different types of hydroponics systems manufactured are NFT system (Nutrient Film Technique), Top Drip systems, Ebb & Flow / Flood & Drain system, Aeroponic systems, Raft/DWC kits, Aggregate based systems (using coco peat) and Customized systems based on the project. In all these systems the plants are raised from good quality seeds. The seeds are grown in coco peat plugs. The germinated seedlings are moved into a net pot which is later suspended into a growing system containing nutrient solution flowing through it. Roxy Philip Hobbyists, conventional farmers interested in hydroponics, entrepreneurs planning for venturing into farming through hydroponics, and Government agriculture departments are the target customers of the company. The response from customers has been encouraging. Mr. Philip shares, “The positive response we are receiving motivates us to create innovative kits. Initially we started with just one kit, and now we have 10 products to offer to our customers. We have sold more than 500 kits last year across the country.” Price depends on kit type and its size. It starts from Rs. 2400 for a Raft system to bigger systems like NFT costing about Rs. 20-30k. Awareness on the products is created through multiple streams. “We participate in selected expos to showcase our systems. We conduct training programs, seminars and discussions in our garden store. We soon shall be launching ebooks featuring hydroponics for Indian conditions,” shares Mr. Pattabiraman. Plan to set up a Greenhouse Hydroponic Lab is also in process. The labs shall have working models of all the kits designed by the company. It shall help the buyers to learn better about the growing/technical process behind hydroponics. It is also working on a unique project where a complete apartment complex in Bangalore shall be getting its organic vegetables (at least 75% of the requirements) from the terrace itself using the technology of hydroponics. Mr. Manikandan Pattabiraman is a Computer Engineer with a decade of experience in Software Industry. He has been associated with growing vegetables since his 3rd grade in engineering. Mr. Roxy Philip is a Hotel Management/MBA graduate. He had managed a hydroponic farm during his stint in Denmark for four years. As of now both the founders are keeping their sales focus only within the country as opportunities are immense. They sign off saying, “We started Geekgardener Greentech to create an ecosystem in India to nurture and propagate hydroponics as a technology. We want to see hydroponics reach every garden in the country.” Our Correspondent Contact details: Geekgardener Greentech, Garden Guru (A unit of Geekgardener Greentech), #4, Shanbhough Nagappa layout. 60 feet road Bilekahalli.
