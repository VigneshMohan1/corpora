Low productivity of mango occurs mainly due to irregular and erratic bearing and damage due to innumerable insects and pests attack and due to pathological harmful diseases. Mango fruit borer (Autocharis albizonalis Hampson) is thought to be recorded as a new pest, causing noticeable damage to the mango cultivation mainly in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka due to injudicious and improper application of pesticides. The pest, mango fruit borer was once a minor pest but recently emerged as a serious alarming pest. The damage due to this alarming pest accounted from 10%-52% damage from the pin head stage to full maturity stage of the fruit development in the New alluvial zones of West Bengal. The pest shows clearly two broods. The first attack by the immature larvae appears in the second to third week of March when fruits show marble stage (about 1 cm in diameter). The second generations appear during fourth week of April to first week of May when the fruits are medium sized to full grown but the kernels are yet to harden. The availability of the fruit is the main factor for the appearance of the borer. In the absence of the fruit the adults fail to reproduce. Although there have been instances where the adult has shown preference to fruits like cashew, avocado, sapota, guava, jackfruit and papaya as its alternate host. The pest attack generally continues till June. The most preferred direction of attack by the pest is mainly the West direction followed by South, then by North and lastly along the East direction. The most susceptible variety in the New alluvial zones of West Bengal , India which shows fruit borer attack is Himsagar and the least susceptible variety is the Neeluddin. Symptoms of Pest infestation: The red banded caterpillar attacks the mango fruits at two stages. The caterpillar hatches from the eggs bores into the tissues of fruits and makes tunnels towards the seed. The distal end of the fruit towards the beak region shows typical small hole which enlarged gradually and faecal matter accumulates inside the fruit. The fruit thus collapses. The second stage of infestation occurs during egg size of the fruit. The secondary microbial infection caused necrosis of the fruit where the injured fruit tissues paves the way for the attack of fungal pathogens. Mango fruit bore , preferably known as the red banded caterpillar (Autocharis albizonalis Hampson), though was a minor pest gradually emerging as a major pest in the Indian subcontinent due to improper and injudicious application of chemical pesticides. The borer attack is found during pea stage to the maturity stage of the fruit.
