If there is something not on this list that you would like us to have, or you need more help with running a program, or you notice a newer version of software that I ought to install please send an email . Most general software is not listed here (except R because it has many bioinformatics packages installed). You will find perl, python, ruby, standard compilers and a wide range of other applications are available but you can always ask if you need more or find we have an out-of-date copy. (In some cases you may even need an older copy; this can happen with, eg, python.) It is possible something is on this list but not on all servers: please ask if you need software on other servers. Some people run software not listed here: both their own code and software they have obtained elsewhere. Please note that most, though not all, software is in /biosoft/bin so if the exact command to use is not obvious trying looking in there. Some packages have many individual programs and you need to know the name of the one you need. Often I have used lower-case for the whole program name even when the published name is partly CAPitals (upper-case). Please ask if you are unsure.
