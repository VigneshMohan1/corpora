Reply With Quote November 27th, 2009 #9 shanta_giri Join Date Nov 2009 Posts 10 Dairy Farming Hi, Great to hear, being an NRI you are also thinking the same way as I do. There is tremendous potential in this business if managed properly. As someone opined, fodder is the main concern in this business. That is true, as it is the major cost component and the whole economy of a dairy farm depends on this. If this is taken care of efficiently and cost effectiveness achieved, then there is no looking back. I have done some research on this business and have come across some great successes in this field. But a word of caution, Medium/small scale is not a viable option, you have to go big. Please keep in touch, we could share our knowledge and experiences since I am also preparing a dairy farm project, likely to implement it in Belgaum 5-6 years down the line. Please contact... Wish you best of luck. Ravindra Last edited by moderator A; November 27th, 2009 at 03:35 PM . Reason: Only Business Members are allowed to post contact info.
