After moisture is removed through the heat treatment, the tea leaves are typically rolled and dried again before ready for use. chinese green tea produces a yellowish green liquor and toasted taste while japanese green tea is dark green in color and has a grassy taste. oolong tea info: oolong tea is another delicious variety of tea. it is also known as wulong (or wu long) tea. Similar to green teas, oolong teas also originate from the camellia sinensis plant and undergo similar processing steps. however, after the tea leaves are picked, they are intentionally bruised by shaking. while the leaves are drying, the edges of the bruised leaves turn reddish in color and the surface becomes light yellow due to fermentation and oxidation. after some fermentation period the tea leaves are pan fired to create a semi-fermented tea. chinese oolong tea is fermented only long enough to achieve 12-20% fermentation and results in a lighter oolong, while a longer period results in 60-70% fermentation of taiwanese oolong teas giving them a stronger oolong flavor.
