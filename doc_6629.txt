Funding from the grant will support local professional development and coaching, curriculum, regional advisory board work, and new academy development.  State Farm employees have long supported NAF locally by serving on NAF advisory boards. In the 2013-14 school year, 21 State Farm employees donated their time by conducting job shadowing events, reviewing student resumes, holding mock interviews, and offering NAF student internships.  This grant will support the professional development and support services provided by the NAF team during the 2015-16 school year, as well as national initiatives, such as curriculum development. NAF’s efforts will focus on the development of work-based learning and advisory boards, aligned to the Western NY region’s workforce development needs. NAF will also work with the Western NY regional board, comprised of business and community leaders, whose engagement will lead to additional work-based learning opportunities for NAF students. According to Tanya Navas, NAF’s New York Director, “The development of a regional advisory board in Western New York will provide additional support to the academies in the area when dealing with the expansion of work-based learning opportunities and internships. It also provides a sense of unity and can help support the needs of academies providing additional resources and advocacy.” About State Farm®  State Farm and its affiliates are the largest provider of car insurance in the U.S. In addition to providing auto insurance quotes, their 18,000 agents and more than 65,000 employees serve over 82 million policies and accounts – nearly 80 million auto, home, life, health and commercial policies, and nearly 2 million bank accounts.
