Looking for partner for my organic herb farm WANTED > Looking for partner for my organic herb farm Hi, I am Sivaram from Ooty, Tamilnadu & engaged in organic cultivation of culinary herbs for 5 acres for past 5 years. Currently I am getting good returns from my culinary herbs & I am planning to start up another farm activity for 5 acres where I will be growing vegetables, fruits & herbs naturally. So I am looking for a partner who is interested in farming & would like to invest. I can promise good returns on your money.
