Chetna Organic continues to organize the farmers into community based organizations based on the program implementation and requirement while promoting cooperatives at cluster level and brings them into Chetna Organic Farmers Association as member institutions and Chetna Organic Agriculture Producer Company Limited (COAPCL) as shareholders.   Chetna Organic Farmers Association (COFA) as process owner of the entire program would strive to build the capacities of the member cooperatives and COAPCL in governance, operational management and developing strategic business plans with the support from guardian organization FFID to help them evolve into member owned and managed sustainable institutions.         Thrust Areas Building Sustainable Institutions Integrated Farming Systems Natural Resources Management Improving Livelihood Options Value Chain Development Food Security and Nutrition Seed Sovereignty Gender Mainstreaming and Child Welfare Copyright © Chetna Organic.
