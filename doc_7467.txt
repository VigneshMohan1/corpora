About Us - Small Farms / Alternative Enterprises - Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension Main Page About Us Extension Offices EDIS Publications Conference Info About Us This web site is developed and maintained by a statewide team of Cooperative Extension Service faculty and staff of the University of Florida and Florida A&M University. Small farms represent over 90% of all farms in Florida, based on the USDA definition of a small farm as one with up to $250,000 in sales. These farms make about 15% of all farm product sales in Florida and have gained much greater visibility as an important sector of the agricultural industry in the “Sunshine State”. Small farmers and allied organizations have identified critical issues facing small farms in Florida. The issues include access to profitable markets, business skills development, accessible technical information, and alternative crops and enterprises. The Small Farms Extension team provides this web site so you can find commonly needed information from "getting started" to "evaluating an alternative enterprise", to "finding a market", all in one place on the web. In addition, the team coordinates several regional workshops, a statewide Florida Small Farms and Alternative Enterprises Conference and regional small farms working groups that meet periodically on operating small farms. You can find the schedule of all of these activities by visiting the Calendar of Events section of the website.
