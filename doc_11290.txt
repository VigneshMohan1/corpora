The firm helps people in preparing projects for all types of bank finance needs including agriculture.

Farmers can receive bank finance with as less queries as possible through VSR consultants. The firm also advices them regarding technology, information regarding various farming techniques adopted in different areas, as per their requirement. The firm approaches different banks giving information about their services. Prospective clientele are met personally or through referrals. However the main challenge was enlisting confidence of bankers and customers. Once they start working together with a win-win strategy their market prominence increased. Mr. Srinivas provides his insight on how farmers can better avail schemes and financial projects offered by the Indian government. “I observe that the farmers generally don’t believe well educated persons because of their usual bad experiences and fear of getting cheated. Government will be able to help through their extension services and the government departments can arrange for seminars involving bankers, scientists, different agricultural equipment company representatives and consultants to educate farmers” he says. He further adds that currently only entrepreneurs are funded by venture capitalists. “Recently, it is learnt some VCs are showing interest in funding cultivation without use of chemical fertilizers & pesticides, by using bio-products. But the problem here is, any funding of this nature require large areas whereas the average land holding in India is very less. At this juncture, I feel that the farmers can utilize different facilities that are being provided by Indian government and different State Governments and the schemes are sufficient to meet any requirement of the farmer” he further informs. VSR consultants plans to help as many farmers and entrepreneurs to get assistance from Banks and Government for their activities. Mr. Srinivas is a Science Graduate from Nagarjuna University. He holds more than 25 years of experience in the banking industry. Our Correspondent Contact : VSR Consultants, D.No.8-3-191/228, Flat No.G-1, SM Residency, Plot No.114/B,Vengalarao Nagar, Hyderabad.
