Expert in poultry and green house farming Mr. Sudharshan runs a private consultancy at Bangalore to render services to farmers. Since the consultancy’s inception, he has helped several poultry farmers, latest among them being a layer farm of 1 Lakh birds. He now has 3 greenhouse projects, each spanning an area of 4000 Sq. mts with spray rose cultivation in it. “My customers are ruralites. I frequent to rural areas of Karnataka and A.P. through known persons. I usually take meetings in villages and there by create awareness” shares Mr. Sudharshan. Speaking of challenges he believes competition, middlemen, diseases, fluctuating market, financial constraint, and high cost of debt are the common issues faced. Mr. Sudharshan shares a success story of his consultancy. Mr. Kadirappa, from a rural place near Chinthamani, had proposed for a small broiler unit of 5000 birds. He helped him out in setting up a deep litter shed for 5000 birds, with just the farmer’s resources. After having pawned his wife’s jewelry, a shed measuring 6000 Sq. ft. of asbestos sheets and brick mud wall with pillars of GI pipes was built and plinth leveled with good gradient slope to drain out water and slurry. Paddy husk was spread of 4” thickness. The strain used for rearing was Vencobb 400, as the birds were fast fed to weight conversion capacity. The chicks gained a body weight of 1.67 kgs in 46 days. The farmer started making good money. The farmer now has 25000 Vencobb broilers and continues to grow in the field. To set up a poultry farm, Mr. Sudharshan suggests 1 acre of land would be ideal for setting up poultry units on smaller scale. He further provides some insight on infected birds in poultry – · The diseased birds show a sign of sloth behavior and would not be active. Early detection and veterinary attention would prevent the mishap. · High sanitation and use anti germ anti- bacteria and anti- virus free lotions of poultry sheds and equipment, high efficiency feed, clean water, sanitized and inoculated chicks are essential to prevent diseases. · Restrict frequency of visitors on farm and in essential situations allow them after sanitizing, and with aprons and gloves. · Veterinarian schedule for vaccinations to be scrupulously followed · Dead birds should be disposed of at a far off place, possibly by burning. When it comes to green houses Mr. Sudharshan says, “A good poly house is built with standard GI pipe, truss, purlins and poly sheet of atleast double layer withstanding a wind velocity of at least 120 K.M/hr. A builder is supposed to provide 3 to 4 years warranty on poly sheets and a minimum of 10 year on steel structure. He should also attend to repairs during the period currency of warranty.” Food cultivated in green houses tend to be a little eon the higher side. However, the yield and quality tend to be much better than the ones grown in open cultivation thus justifying the price. Mr. Sudharshan holds a B.Sc in Agriculture with CAIIB.
