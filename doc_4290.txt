The site also focuses on the current scenario of BPO Infrastructure in India. The first batch of BPO or business process outsourcing players, came in primarily for low cost and high quality services, the second batch fell for rapid ramping up of operations and a modern BPO infrastructure , which propelled India's economic growth to a new horizon. Although, the government has done a commendable job in attracting investments so far, it needs to do even better to match up with the MNC BPOs demand for a world class BPO infrastructure. Foreign investments in the area of BPO Infrastructure has an important role to play. There is an urgent need to bolster rapidly available space. It important to make sure that good quality space for BPO companies are available readily. As the lack of such modern BPO infrastructure would repeal the companies away to other destinations. The government also needs to restructure areas like stamp duty rates. On an average different countries like Philippines, Ireland or Australia are asking for 1.5% to 3% on stamp duty, while Indian rates are much higher than those of their competitors. So the government should work towards reducing it to a nominal level. It is estimated that over 100 million sq ft of land will be engaged in BPO companies in India by the end of 2008. Moreover, steel and cement worth over Rs 28 billion will be needed to build proper BPO Infrastructure in India to encompass this land area. Further, this is likely to generate employment for 5 lakh people in India. Developing BPO infrastructure is an important aspect for the development of Indian economy to grab the BPO pie. India's strengths lies in experience, language proficiency, entrepreneurial zeal, skilled workers, expertise in new technologies and a cost advantage. The services offered by the BPO companies are in HR, finance and accounting, transaction processing, content development, engineering, design, remote education, market research, data search, network consultancy, etc. Indian BPO industry is essentially still in the early stages of evolution. The Indian BPO market is in its early high growth phase and is growing at an astronomical pace. The Indian BPO Industry has the potential to drive India's economic growth through the next few years.
