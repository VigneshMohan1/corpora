Sample Survey Resource Server is a web resource created with a goal to disseminate research in theory, application and computational aspects of sample survey among the statisticians in academia,practicing statisticians involved in advisory and consultancy services, scientists in the National Agricultural Research System, and the statisticians involved in conducting large scale sample surveys, particularly in the National Statistical System with focus on agricultural statistical system.This resource focuses on propagating research in sample survey including designing a survey, estimation procedures with support of online software for computing purposes, analysis of survey data, e-learning, etc. This resource is useful to surveyors in agricultural sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, industry and in statistical organizations in the centre and the states in planning and designing surveys and then in analysing the complex survey data generated. One important feature of the resource is the Discussion Forum that aims at providing online advisory and consultancy to the surveyors in general and surveyors in agriculture in particular. This forum also provides a platform to establish a network of statisticians, survey statisticians and survey practitioners. Another important feature of the resource is the link "Ask a Question" through which the user can ask questions and seek clarifications through Email. The ultimate objective of this resource is to provide e-advisory services. Electronic books on theory of sample surveys and survey data analysis techniques with emphasis on agriculture are also available on this resource. An online software package is available for the analysis of survey data. It is expected that the material provided at this server would help the survey practitioners in general and in agricultural sciences in particular and those survey practitioners involved in planning, designing and analysis of large scale complex surveys in the national statistical system in improving the quality of research in their respective sciences and making their research globally competitive. The server is matter-of-factly a mobile library on the theory of Sample Survey. The server is dynamic in nature and new additions would be posted on this site from time to time. It is designed and developed by Dr. V. K. Gupta (vkgupta@iasri.res.in) , National Professor and his research unit, Dr. U.C.
