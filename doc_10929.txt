Go to the shop Solar solutions in the agro industry Home Solar solutions in the agro industry Insights from a seller and a user SunBright Energy Solutions Ravi Chalasani SunBright Energy Solutions was established in 2012. The company’s main operation is solar water pumping solutions for agriculture and domestic use. It assembles and produces solar based water pumping solutions. Based on customer requirement, government instructions and financial status of the customer, the company provides suitable solar solutions to customers. These products are sold by the brand name Sun Bright Energy Solutions. The manufacturers from which the company assembles its products hold certification, rural agency registration certificate and assembly registration. It then trade marks the product for the company. Installation: The products offered by the company are purely powered by solar power. No cost except the initial installation costs need to be incurred. Farmers can thus use the pumps from 8 am to evening 6pm despite irregular supply of power. This also helps the farmers and labourers to involve themselves completely in other farm activities. “We first test the quality as per the government norm. We have never compromised on the quality when compared to other technology. The technology we use is very useful to customers in efficiency of the panels and in water pouring capacity” shares Mr. Ravi Chalasani, one of the promoters of the company. Maintenance: These solar panels require no maintenance cost of any kind. All that one needs to do is clean the panels every day or once in 3 days depending on the variance of dust in the place where the panels are installed. Cost: Initially the solar based water pumping solution’s cost will be high compared to electricity. However it has 25 years life and compatibility of the working time in the safety of the motor. This solar pumping solution is more useful to customers. One need not start or stop the motor. It operates itself in the presence of light and switches off in the dark. Challenges faced by the company: The only challenge the company faces with regards to solar panels is convincing the farmers of its profitability. The company uses previously installed panels by farmers to explain the compatibility of the motor to reluctant farmers. It also relies on tele marketing and other media to make its products and its benefits, known to farmers.

PH : 0866-6575677,M.09966505559 E –ravi.chalasani@sunbrightenergy.net Website – www.sunbrightenergy.net Fruit Orchard Ravi Mandava Mr. Ravi Mandava of Fruit Orchard has been using solar solutions’ solar water pump since August 2013. Settled in the US for the last 15 years, he came back to India to take care of his ailing father. About 1750 acid lime plants, 1450 guava plants, 12 mango plants, 300 orange plants constitute the 35.24 acres farm. The plants in the orchard will start yielding in the next 4 years. When they grow and start yielding, the produce will be used for commercial purpose. Water pumping in the farm : Water pumping needs of the orchard are met with two electrical and two solar pumps to pump water from 4 wells. For solar pumping, Mr. Ravi uses 5 horse power motors which is standard for subsidies that the central government provides. He holds 5 horsepower motor 7 phase pump. Water level is at 140 feet below which is pulled up by the pump. Water is discharged by 2 inches tube. All the water is discharged using this solar system. Electrical motor vs. Solar motors : In the time of power crisis, Mr. Ravi prefers solar pumps. With as little as 2 hours of power supply in a day, solar pump is beneficial and useful for safeguarding the growth of plants. However, Mr. Ravi finds electrical motors over solar motors as motor pumping happens more in the former. The pressure of the water is also more when compared to solar pumps, and so is the efficiency. The cost of the solar based motors is 6.5 lakhs excluding vat for each unit. If it is supposed to run for about 25 years, solar pump sets are much effective and efficient in the long run. Experience with solar motors : As long as there is sunlight, the water pumping is fine. Mr. Ravi faced a few technical issues with solar panels, which were fixed by the company’s after sales team. “I got 3 solar systems but only 2 were successful. I am contemplating on having one more solar pump based on my experience. If not solar I have to buy a generator and pump water”, Mr. Ravi shares. “So far so good. I am satisfied with the company’s service” he sums up his experience.
