It was thought that if LEISA India has to become a movement it has to be built in small ‘steps’. These steps need to be rooted in democratic principles and a spirit of volunteerism. Two LEISA Alliance meets were organized, one in the North and one in the South bringing together LEISA enthusiasts, which facilitated knowledge sharing.
