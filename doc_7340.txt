http://localhost/seeds/Material/Seed_Storage.htm SEED STORAGE               In India there are basically two crop seasons:  Kharif and Rabi. Kharif season is more important. The kharif seed crop starts reaching the plants in December and its processing continues till April end. In May Certified/Labeled seeds are dispatched to various centers for timely availability in the beginning of the season. Seeds are required to be kept in safe storage since they are harvested in the preceding season and usually used for sowing in the subsequent season often after a time gap of six months or longer. Thus proper storage are required to keep seeds in good condition. Some varieties needs air conditioned storage. Storages costs are also added in order to drive cost of seeds.
