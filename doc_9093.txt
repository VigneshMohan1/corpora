Dear Readers, "Mr. Mandar Ratnakar Walawalkar, Member - Abhinav Farmers Club says - Farming as individual is absolutely not possible. The group farming and that too Organic is the future. The farmers must be united and practice the latest technologies. They should stop expecting subsidies from govt. and start on their own." Please reply back to this thread to tell us why you agree or disagree with this statement.

Ramakrishnan, Santhosh Farms says- No doubt Group farming is of course a good solution for today’s problems. Again there is a bottle neck in applying that concept. Once you form a group and apply for some concessions , it is expected that the group should be a registered one. Once you register the group, ( all the unwanted formalities are to be followed ) you are in the clutch of rules and regulations. A government officer will soon guide or lead the group , and that will be the end of it.

However exploitation of farmers by the middleman continuous since farmer is not in a position to sell it directly to the customers. More often than not people in the chain make much more profit than the farmer who puts in the maximum effort. Cheap and subsidized technology needs to be made available to the farmer to enable him to introduce the technology and insulate him from the fear or actual losses.

But there has to a start. Who will bell the cat. Everybody wants to win a race without running one. And that is why we keep saying that if you want to know what is good you should first understand what is bad, how bad it is and how to come out of it.

Correct. But you can’t divert a farmer towards the new technology and it will take some time for this. Subsidy should reach a farmer directly and that too as soon as possible.

Every day we are eating lots of chemicals through the fertilizers applied on agricultural produce which is very harmful for us. Ensemble Systems Esha Garden C 601, D.P.

So, I believe if there is any kinds of facilities provide by the government we must utilize those facilities. Those subsidies encourages the farmers to grow more, if we are talking about the small farmers then the cost of technology set up is very high which can be possible to procure only which the help of government. If they stop rely on government then either the yield decreases or the agri-land will be converted into commercial land. Which increases the inflation rates of the agro products and thus hampers the economics of the country. I would say if the government encourages the farmers individually or in a group through promoting new technology, Training Farmers, simplification of the formalities towards the application of the subsidies then it would have been more flourishing. In our scenario we have venture individually as a company under NHB scheme but we didn’t rely on the government because of their complicated procedure, but we always thought of Subsidies as a bonus. But what about the individual farmers on a product like Cymbidium which took almost three years to flower, how would they survive.

Farmers need to come together and find solutions to their day-to-day problems. Technology is only an enabler and will help them achieve the solutions that they seek. I don't fully agree that they should stop expecting support from the government. The government is equally responsible to support the community, not only by way of subsidies, but managing the water resources, spreading awareness of healthy farm practices - all needs to be looked into by the government. However, depending solely on government support also will not help either.

Durga Prasad Rao, Proprietor and Farmer, Sai Durga Overseas says- Farmers must be united because when we work in a group the strength becomes more powerful. Yes, in India it’s not yet adopted fully but we can learn things how we can reduce more risks by group farming rather than individual. We have to build trust on each other and should make transparent policies. I believe group farming reduces more losses and people can be more updated time to time. Govt. policies are available to help farmers but they cannot depend on them. They have their own courage to prove themselves by unite and updated about new technologies of smart farming.
