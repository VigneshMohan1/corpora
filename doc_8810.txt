Current Drought Scenario 6. Current Drought Scenario Drought Declaration by States during 2008 At the outset it is mentioned that considering the exigencies of Indian Agriculture, the year in which droughts occur are counted from July to June e.g. a drought in 2008 will be a drought which is notified between July 2008 or thereafter and which is deemed to come to an end by June 2009 and so on. The rationale for this approach is the fact that droughts, mostly arise due to aberrations in SW Monsoon, which appear earliest in July; with the onset of next SW Monsoon in June the next cycle starts. During the year 2008, State Governments of Karnataka, Rajasthan & Uttarakhand have declared drought. The details of drought declaration are as under.
