Technology has been developing day by day, and the progress of farmers will be following new technology which the farmers won’t do. They will stick on to their old traditional methods due to which they won’t get as much profit as they expect. Educated farmers must learn to use internet in order to know new technologies with full specifications and videos which surely will be very helpful to them. Adapting new technologies in goat farming will surely help in progress of goat farmers with their profit.

But also many agencies are there like ours that they provide such information in their services for those who don’t have such internet and media facilities.

To be frank, I am not related to agriculture except that I have some acres of rubber plantation, inherited from my father. Now, I am doing the business of distribution of seeds across Kerala and I feel very happy with this. I am getting all sort of information, mainly from the internet. I used to watch videos of agriculture based programmes in TV, getting information on various type of seeds, Companies, fertilizers, cultivation practices etc. It is important that sitting in my room I can make an understanding of various cultivation practices followed by people from all part of the world. Through the internet only I came to know about many varieties of vegetable seeds, which were not known to me earlier. Any variety of seeds can be purchased through the internet. Undoubtedly we can say that the internet has rendered yeoman service to the agriculture community in a number of ways. The limitation is that a major portion of the farmers are not used to internet and has no means to access the internet. Steps must be taken to pass all required information from internet to the farmers. Agri based magazines, articles in newspapers, TV & Radio programmes are also very good and reach large number of people. We can survive only with adopting the latest technologies.

I think it will still take a Decade for the Online Trading to penetrate the Rural Market of Uttar Pradesh because of the Govt. Agri Policies. There are no such things as dedicated Organic Product Market where buyer both National & International can come & purchase the Organic Farm Produce directly from the Farmer's Community here in Uttar Pradesh. I think the New Central Govt. will take the "Bold-Courage" of doing something 'Good' specially for the Farmer & Grower Community. I think Agricultureinfomationi.com will do something regarding it.

Internet of course is the best thing that has happened to information technology. But the farmer always acts locally. Therefore chances of his local requirement being in the net are a bit of a coincidence. What is more important is that the farmer gets inputs to a whole lot of new crops and technologies, which he can adopt with some changes to suit local conditions. But making this the only way is at this point of time a very premature statement. Toyo Biotech TOYO Adoor House, Thevally P.O.

This depend on the group of farmers. If the demography of farmers play a major role. but overall i think in the time of fast Information technology where Radio, T.V. News paper, magazine, books all are available on internet. undermining the importance of internet to reach to the farmer will be a concept without imagination. Today Internet is available on mobile. laptop, computer, tablet it is vary convenient to access internet anywhere. One cant carry the news paper . magazine , every time but internet can be any where. Internet can give wide range of ways to explain the things like Video, Image, leaflet, power point, voice message. It is very fast. It is approachable every where with mobile network. Internet is not time bound. Farmer can access it as per his time availability. Internet is also cheaper that other media. Farmer cant subscribe 4-5 newspaper, 4 magazine, but he can access all of them over internet. Internet is updated regularly and latest information are available on internet. Internet itself is a group of media. It is completely different from Print Media. Still there are many area where mobile network is not available then we can go for other media.
