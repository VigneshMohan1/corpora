It manufactures and supplies spices and herbal products in the International market. It is also into cultivation of seaweeds in the ocean. It is a family business based at Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. Presently fourth generation of Thivakar family, Mr. P.S.S.G Thivakar is the CEO of the company. The company procures all the products, namely different spices and herbal crops from farmers. Mr. Thivakar is quite proud of the quality standards maintained at the company and says, “We are getting regular business from the buyers as we are supplying good material to them.” Primarily the products are exported to Russia, Europe, and also to some parts of Japan. All agri products dealt at PSSGT Export are SGS certified. “We opted for SGS certification because some companies in International market prefer SGS while some countries ask for GEOCHEM certificate to show our products’ worthiness,” says Mr. Thivakar and adds, “Apart from certification, ECGC reports, good quality products, and cleaning the material twice before dispatch are the crucial factors for attaining success in agri exports.” Speaking about the competition, Mr. Thivakar shares, “Yes, it is very competitive in the international market. However, dirty competition amongst our countrymen is the only big headache for us.” In addition he seeks support from government for exporters and adds, “I am producing seaweeds in the ocean but not allowed to export because I am a small company and big companies are getting export license.” Irrespective of all challenges and problems Mr. Thivakar insists agri exports fetches more profit when compared to domestic sales. To start a finished goods factory at Tuticorin and move the work load in India itself are the future plans of the company. “Also as a next step we want to get into extraction of herbals in my area and my son, the fifth generation of the family, will look after the expansion,” informs Mr. Thivakar. He is a non-graduate. He gives credit to his wife for the company’s success. “She is helping me in my business. She holds Ph.D,” signs off Mr. Thivakar.
