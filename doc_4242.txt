Source: IANS About Banking System In India The concept of Banking in India dates back to the first half of 18th century. The first bank that was established in the country was The General Bank of India founded in 1786. After that came the State Bank of India in Kolkata in 1806 which was then known as The Bank of Bengal. The operations of all the banks in India are controlled by the Reserve Bank of India. All the Indian banks are governed by the RBI or Reserve Bank of India. This governing body took over the reasonability of formally regulating the Indian banks in 1935. The Reserve Bank of India was announced as the official Central Banking Authority for the smooth supervision of the banking industry in India. Banks in India are classified into 2 broad categories namely, Public sector banks and Private sector banks. The banking scenario in India has already gained momentum, with the domestic and international banks gathering pace. All the banks in India are following the 'cost', determined by revenue minus profit model. This means that all the resources should be used efficiently to improve the productivity and ensure a win-win situation. To survive in the long run, it is essential to focus on cost saving. Previously, banks focused on the 'revenue' model which is equal to cost plus profit. Post the banking reforms, banks shifted their approach to the 'profit' model, which meant that banks aimed at higher profit maximization. Public Sector Banks In India Banks such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank and Canara Bank are known as Public sector banks. Public sector banks are controlled and managed by the Government of India. Public sector banks have been serving the nation for over centuries and are well known for their affordable and quality services. The banking sector in India is mostly dominated by the Public sector banks. The Public sector banks in India alone account for about 75 percent of the total advances in the Indian banking industry. Public sector banks have shown remarkable growth over the last five four decades. Allahabad Bank was the first fully owned Indian bank. It was founded in the year 1865.

This was mostly because the private banks were technologically well equipped. Online banking is extremely common today since you can sit anywhere and go ahead with your banking transactions. You do not have to personally visit your bank. The Private sector banks were using state of the art technology and fully computerized systems since the time they entered the Indian market whereas the Public sector banks were not. However despite the technological challenges the public sector banks in India are still the preferred destinations for many as they are considered as safer options for money deposit.
