But, exogenous factors such as drastic climatic variations, input-expensive farming practices and market cartels deny him this right. Chetna Organics would engage in developing ethical value chains for various commodities in collaboration and with farmers as equal partner based on the principles of ecological (hence Organic), and social (hence Fair Trade) sustainability and profitability at the same time (self supporting). Towards this, Chetna would provide support to the Chetna Organic Agriculture Producer Company Limited (COAPCL) and other cooperatives to achieve financial and institutional self sufficiency required for adding value to the base products during processing so that these products can create their own niche in the markets.     Thrust Areas Building Sustainable Institutions Integrated Farming Systems Natural Resources Management Improving Livelihood Options Value Chain Development Food Security and Nutrition Seed Sovereignty Gender Mainstreaming and Child Welfare Copyright © Chetna Organic.
