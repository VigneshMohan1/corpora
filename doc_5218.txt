Sesamum Sesame plants Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae (unranked): Angiosperms (unranked): Eudicots (unranked): Asterids Order: Lamiales Family: Pedaliaceae Genus: Sesamum Species: S. indicum Binomial name Sesamum indicum L. Synonyms [ 1 ] Dysosmon amoenum Raf. Sesamum africanum Tod. Sesamum occidentalis Heer & Regel Sesamum oleiferum Sm. Sesamum orientale L. Volkameria orientalis (L.) Kuntze Sesame ( / ˈ s ɛ s ə m iː / ; Sesamum indicum ) is a flowering plant in the genus Sesamum . Numerous wild relatives occur in Africa and a smaller number in India. It is widely naturalized in tropical regions around the world and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which grow in pods. Sesame seed is one of the oldest oilseed crops known, domesticated well over 3000 years ago. Sesame has many species, most being wild and native to sub-Saharan Africa . Sesame Indicum, the cultivated type, originated in India. [ 2 ] Sesame is highly tolerant to drought like conditions, and grows where other crops may fail. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Sesame has one of the highest oil contents of any seed. With a rich nutty flavor, it is a common ingredient in cuisines across the world. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Like other nuts and foods, it can trigger allergic reactions in some people. [ 7 ] The world harvested about 4.8 million metric tonnes of sesame seeds in 2013. [ 8 ] The largest producer of sesame seeds in 2013 was Myanmar . [ 8 ] The world's largest exporter of sesame seeds was India, and Japan the largest importer. Flower of Sesamum indicum Sesame in Panchkhal valley, Nepal Magnified image of white sesame seeds It is an annual plant growing 50 to 100 cm (1.6 to 3.3 ft) tall, with opposite leaves 4 to 14 cm (1.6 to 5.5 in) long with an entire margin; they are broad lanceolate , to 5 cm (2 in) broad, at the base of the plant, narrowing to just 1 cm (0.4 in) broad on the flowering stem. The flowers are yellow, tubular, 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 in) long, with a four-lobed mouth. The flowers may vary in colour with some being white, blue or purple. Sesame fruit is a capsule, normally pubescent, rectangular in section and typically grooved with a short triangular beak. The length of the fruit capsule varies from 2 to 8 cm, its width varies between 0.5 to 2 cm, and the number of loculi from 4 to 12. The fruit naturally splits open (dehisces) to release the seeds by splitting along the septa from top to bottom or by means of two apical pores, depending on the varietal cultivar. The degree of dehiscence is of importance in breeding for mechanised harvesting as is the insertion height of the first capsule. Sesame seeds are small. The size, form and colours vary with the thousands of varieties now known. Typically, the seeds are about 3 to 4 millimeters long by 2 millimeters wide and 1 millimeter thick. The seeds are ovate, slightly flattened and somewhat thinner at the eye of the seed (hilum) than at the opposite end. The weight of the seeds is between 20 and 40 milligrams. [ 6 ] The seed coat (testa) may be smooth or ribbed. Sesame seeds come in many colours depending on the cultivar harvested. The most traded variety of sesame is off-white coloured. Other common colours are buff, tan, gold, brown, reddish, gray and black. Sesame seed is sometimes sold with its seed coat removed (decorticated). This is the variety often present on top of buns in developed economies.

From the roots above, words with the generalized meaning “oil, liquid fat” are derived. Sesame names vary among numerous languages. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Origins [ edit ] Sesame seed is considered to be the oldest oilseed crop known to humanity. [ 3 ] Sesame has many species, and most are wild. Most wild species of the genus Sesamum are native to sub-Saharan Africa . Sesame Indicum, the cultivated type, [ 2 ] [ 12 ] originated in India. [ 7 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Charred remains of sesame recovered from archeological excavations have been dated to 3500-3050 BC. [ 15 ] Fuller claims trading of sesame between Mesopotamia and the Indian sub-continent occurred by 2000 BC. [ 16 ] Some reports claim sesame was cultivated in Egypt during the Ptolemiac period, [ 17 ] while others suggest the New Kingdom [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Records from Babylon and Assyria , dating about 4000 years ago mention sesame. Egyptians called it sesemt, and it is included in the list of medicinal drugs in the scrolls of the Ebers Papyrus dated to be over 3600 years old. Archeological reports from Turkey indicate that sesame was grown and pressed to extract oil at least 2750 years ago in the empire of Urartu. [ 6 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The historic origin of sesame was favored by its ability to grow in areas that do not support the growth of other crops. It is also a robust crop that needs little farming support—it grows in drought conditions, in high heat, with residual moisture in soil after monsoons are gone or even when rains fail or when rains are excessive. It was a crop that could be grown by subsistence farmers at the edge of deserts, where no other crops grow. Sesame has been called a survivor crop. [ 4 ] Cultivation [ edit ] Sesame output in 2005 Sesame is very drought-tolerant, in part due to its extensive root system. However, it requires adequate moisture for germination and early growth. While the crop survives drought as well as presence of excess water, the yields are significantly lower in either conditions. Moisture levels before planting and flowering impact yield most. Most commercial cultivars of sesame are intolerant of water-logging. Rainfall late in the season prolongs growth and increases high harvest-shattering losses. Wind can also cause shattering at harvest. Initiation of flowering is sensitive to photoperiod and to sesame variety. The photoperiod also impacts the oil content in sesame seed; increased photoperiod increases oil content. The oil content of the seed is inversely proportional to its protein content. Sesame varieties have adapted to many soil types. The high yielding crops thrive best on well-drained, fertile soils of medium texture and neutral pH. However, these have low tolerance for soils with high salt and water-logged conditions. Commercial sesame crops require 90 to 120 frost free days. Warm conditions above 23 °C (73 °F) favor growth and yields. While sesame crops can grow in poor soils, the best yields come from properly fertilized farms. [ 6 ] [ 23 ] Since sesame is a small flat seed, it is difficult to dry it after harvest because the small seed makes movement of air around the seed difficult. Therefore, the seeds need to be harvested as dry as possible and stored at 6 percent moisture or less. If the seed is too moist, it can quickly heat up and become rancid. [ 5 ] Processing [ edit ] After harvesting, the seeds are usually cleaned and hulled. In some countries, once the seeds have been hulled, they are passed through an electronic colour-sorting machine that rejects any discolored seeds to ensure perfectly coloured sesame seeds. This is done because sesame seeds with consistent appearance are perceived to be of better quality by consumers, and sell for a higher price. Immature or off-sized seeds are removed and used for oil production. Production and trade [ edit ] Top five sesame producers in 2013 [ 8 ] Country Production (million ton) Yields (ton/hectare)   Myanmar 0.89 0.56   India 0.64 0.34   China 0.59 1.31   Sudan 0.56 0.26   Tanzania 0.42 0.67 World Total 4.8 0.49 In 2013, the global harvest from an aggregate of 9.4 million hectares was about 4.8 million metric tonnes of sesame seeds, with Myanmar, India and China as the top three producers accounting for 44 percent of global production (table). [ 8 ] In total for 2013, Asia produced 2.46 million metric tons, the most of any continent . [ 8 ] The most productive sesame seed farms in the world in 2013 were in the European Union with an average composite yield of 6.3 metric tonnes per hectare (compared to the global average of 0.5); [ 8 ] Italy reported the highest nationwide yield of 8.5 metric tonnes per hectare. [ 8 ] There is a large yield gap and farm loss differences between major sesame seed producers, in part because of knowledge gap , poor crop management practices and use of technologies. The white and other lighter coloured sesame seeds are common in Europe, the Americas, West Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The black and darker coloured sesame seeds are mostly produced in China and southeast Asia. Africa produces a variety of sesame seeds. [ citation needed ] Beginning in the 1950s, U.S. production of the crop has been largely centered in Texas, with acreage fluctuating between 10,000 to 20,000 acres (40 to 80 km 2 ) in recent years. The country's crop does not make up a significant global source; indeed imports have now outstripped domestic production. [ 23 ] Trade [ edit ] The world traded over a billion dollars worth of sesame seeds in 2010. The trade volume has been increasing rapidly in the last two decades. Japan is the world's largest sesame importer. Sesame oil, particularly from roasted seed, is an important component of Japanese cooking and traditionally the principal use of the seed. China is the second largest importer of sesame, mostly oil-grade sesame. China exports lower priced food grade sesame seeds, particularly to southeast Asia. Other major importers are the United States, Canada, Netherlands, Turkey and France. Sesame seed is a high value cash crop. Sesame prices have ranged between US$800 to 1700 per metric ton between 2008 and 2010. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Sesame exports sell across a wide price range. Quality perception, particularly how the seed looks, is a major pricing factor. Most importers who supply ingredient distributors and oil processors only want to purchase scientifically treated, properly cleaned, washed, dried, colour-sorted, size-graded and impurity-free seeds with a guaranteed minimum oil content (not less than 40 percent) packed according to international standards. Seeds that do not meet these quality standards are considered unfit for export and are consumed locally. In 2008, by volume, by premium prices and by quality, the largest exporter was India, followed by Ethiopia and Myanmar.
