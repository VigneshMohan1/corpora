The following is the summary of achievements of Chetna so far; A total number of ~15,279 farmers covered as on August 2012 out of which ~9647 farmers are administered in organic certification from the group of small and marginalized farmers. Out of the total farmers, 94% of the farmers own below 2 hectares of land and come under small and marginal farmer’s category. Chetna Organic is in the process of covering an additional ~2938 farmers during the 2012-13 cropping season by expanding into new villages in the same districts where it is currently operating through different government programs (eg. Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) in Adilabad district with INR.55 million outlay, Convergence of Agriculture Initiatives in Maharashtra (CAIM) Program supported by IFAD and Government of Maharashtra and Orissa Tribal Empowerment and Livelihoods Project (OTELP) supported by IFAD and Government of Orissa) All ~15,279 farmers in Chetna are organized into ~978 farmer Self Help Groups which are federated into ~13 cluster level cooperatives. During the current phase, all cooperatives engaged in aggregation of their members, produce and collect sales through the Chetna Organic Agriculture Producer Company Limited. They have generated a trade surplus of over INR.15million and attracted additional INR.50million as investments/grants/subsidies from associated brands, government agencies and banks;  Economic Impact Chetna’s cotton intervention in Odisha has touched the lives of 3000 farmers and created over Euro.563,300 of additional income Chetna’s market interventions have created additional incomes to the tune of Euro.283,300 in two years for its 3000 strong member farmers. Additionally, around Euro. 130,000 of trade surpluses at the co-operative level were generated apart from about Euro. 85,000 investments from client brands in farmer welfare Chetna has brought almost 3000 farmers and 5000 acres of land under organic practices which is saving around Euro.150,000 of cultivation costs for the farmer community per year Chetna’s seed multiplication program has scaled up to produce indigenous cotton seed sufficient for 1800 acres of  cotton farms in Orissa COFA rated as Best Project Facilitating Agency among the partner NGOs of Indo-German Watershed Development Program (IGWDP) supported by NABARD and KfW, Germany and a cash prize of INR.100,000 with certificate of appreciation awarded by NABARD for the year 2011; COFA is anchoring the soil fertility sub group consisting of 7 partner NGOs across India to generate field experiences at a reasonable scale on diversifying farming systems of the small and marginal farmers, and at other end, to evolve a relevant policy framework for rainfed agriculture in dry regions from these experiences. The core objective is to identify required public support systems, institutional mechanisms and technology options to provide a basis for a sustainable rainfed agriculture policy; Turnover of COAPCL increased from INR.35 million in 2009 to INR.115 in 2010 – 11 and profitability from INR.3.5 million to INR.7 million; Intensive extension services by Chetna Organic to promote sustainable organic practices have helped stabilize productivity over the years, particularly in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. An analysis of productivity of the Chetna Organic farmers has shown an increased trend from 255KGs/Acre in 2009-10 to 608KGs/Acre in 2011-12. The following table gives the overview of the changes in productivity  in Odisha; COFA selected as expert panel member for Mahila Kisan Sushaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) under National Rural Livelihoods Mission (MoRD) and supported drafting of guidelines, proposals, budget templates and also assisted in rating proposals, etc; The Agriculture resource support by Chetna for Western Orissa NREGA Consortium has been highlighted as a model practice in the NREGA case-study experiences book published by the National Consortium on NREGA. The book was launched by and carried a foreword by the then Union Minister for Rural Development, GOI; Chetna Organic Impact Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) ,a Government of India agency, evaluated the program of Chetna based on the study of 100 households came out with the following findings; Chetna Organic’s market interventions have created additional incomes to the tune of Euro.283,300 in two years for its 3000 strong member farmers. Additionally, around Euro. 130,000 of trade surpluses at the co-operative level were generated apart from about Euro. 85,000 investments from client brands in farmer welfare Chetna Organic has brought almost 3000 farmers and 5000 acres of land under organic practices which is saving around Euro.150,000 of cultivation costs for the farmer community per year Chetna Organic’s seed multiplication program has scaled up to produce indigenous cotton seed sufficient for 1800 acres of  cotton farms in Orissa   Cluster Average yield/acre during 2011-12 Average yield/acre during 2010-11 Average yield/acre during 2009-10 Bhawanipatna 6.31 5.23 2.73 Golamunda 5.97 5.54 3.44 Lanjigarh 6.29 4.53 0 Kantabanj 5.76 5.18 4.04 Average Yield 6.0825 5.12 2.55099   In order to address the issue of promoting access to organic seed, Chetna Organic has undertaken Participatory Seed Evaluation in collaboration with University of Agriculture Science, Dharwad (one of the pioneer universities in seed breeding and produced highly successful varieties and hybrids in cotton). This has been successfully piloted and scaled up with over 700 varieties and hybrids. The actual production of organic seed for 3000 acres as targeted for this reporting year will be realized only in 2012. It was realized that it is essential to properly trial the available varieties to ensure that farmers accept these.   Chetna Organic, during the next phase of three years (2012-13) is traversing towards evolving into a vibrant farmers’ support organization that works towards addressing the multidimensional challenges encountered by the smallholder farmers from rain fed regions. The interventions range from natural resource management, promotion of sustainable agriculture, conservation of germ plasm, diversification of livelihood portfolio of farmer households, value chain development beyond cotton, food and nutrition security, gender mainstreaming and child welfare.   About Us Vision & Mission Organisational Structure Board of Directors Operational Area Achievements Copyright © Chetna Organic.
