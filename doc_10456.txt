Go to the shop Mr. Prakash Kumar Vaghasiya – Mango farming Home Mr. Prakash Kumar Vaghasiya – Mango farming Chooses to take father’s mango farming business to  new heights over a regular job after completing  post-graduation Prakash Kumar Vaghasiya Ankolwadi, a village in Gujarat, India, is known for its mangoes. There are more than 20 farmers growing mangoes here. One amongst them is Mr. Prakash Kumar Vaghasiya who is looking after his father’s mango farm spread over 20 acres having 1000 trees. He completed his post-graduation in agriculture and was fortunate to get a full-time job in a reputed company but as he always felt proud of his father he was quick in taking the decision to take up farming as his livelihood instead of working for someone else. “We are growing exclusively Kesar mangoes in our farm. Last year produce was around 200 quintals. We only use cow dung at our farm. Rarely, we mix some chemical based medicine in the cow dung to protect the farm from pest. However, the percentage of chemical in the medicine is very less,” shares Mr. Vaghasiya. Majority area of the farm is equipped with drip irrigation facility since three years. “I am satisfied with drip irrigation and planning to install in the rest of the area soon. I have taken Government subsidy at the time of purchase,” he adds. He is all praise for Gujarat Government that provided mango farmers of Ankolwadi rent-free shops in Gandhinagar market to sell mangoes directly to the customers. The facility was started four years ago. Each farmer needs to apply for the shop as per the scheme. It takes 15-20 days to receive the approval and allotment of the individual shop. Farmers collectively bring mangoes using a common vehicle from their farms to Gandhinagar market and share the transportation cost. “We are given the shops for fixed period during the mango season. Certainly it is more profitable to sell mangoes directly to customers rather than giving it to the middleman. We can maintain our quality and quantity as well. Buyers have started knowing us for our quality. I feel we are somehow able to create our market by ourselves,” admits Mr. Vaghasiya. Previously one kg mango was sold to the middleman for Rs. 300 but through direct sales farmers are able to sell at Rs. 500, earning the profit of Rs. 200 per kg. “Direct sales helped us to earn better and till last year our expenses for the shop maintenance was also taken care by the Government but henceforth we have to bear the maintenance cost ourselves for which we are a little upset,” he adds. In time to come, he plans to start a small dairy unit to sell milk and also getting into producing value added milk products. “And I would also get natural fertilizer for my mango farm with this new venture,” signs off Mr. Vaghasiya.
