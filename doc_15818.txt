It has developed by the gradual assimilation of cultures and traditions of various ethno-cultural groups. Assamese culture is closely associated with some of the major elements like festivals, dance, music, paintings and traditional crafts. A number of traditional festivals are celebrated in Assam , among them Bihu is the most important. Three Bihus are celebrated by the people of Assam, they are rongali or 'bohag bihu', celebrated at the onset of spring and the sowing season; kongali or 'kati bihu', when the farms are full with crops but the barns are empty; and the bhogali or 'magh bihu', the thanksgiving for the harvested crops. Rongali bihu is closely related to many Bihu songs and Bihu dances. The other traditional festivals celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups include Ali-aye-ligang, Hacha-kekan, Kherai, Porag, Awnkham Gwrlwi Janai, Chojun/Swarak, Me-dam-me-phi, Hapsa Hatarnai, Rongker, Sokk-erroi and Garja.
