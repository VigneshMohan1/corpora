These policies cover both domestic and international travel. People can also arrange travel insurance on a temporary basis so that they can cover only the trip. Multi trip policies are also available - these plans normally cover any number of tours within a particular time frame. These plans differ in terms of coverage and can include areas with higher levels of risk like winter sports. Travel Insurance Coverage The travel insurance policies normally cover the following areas: Medical emergencies such as accident or sickness Accidental death, disablement, or injury benefits Evacuation on an emergency basis Costs of funeral outside the country Repatriating remains Baggage, travel papers, or personal effects lost, damaged, or stolen Returning a minor Baggage delayed and substitution of necessary items on an emergency basis Cancellation of trips Missing flight connection owing to schedule of the carrier Interruption of tours Delays in travel owing to weather conditions These plans also cover additional areas like the following: Pre existing conditions like diabetes or asthma Extra accidental death and dismemberment coverage Sports that are deemed to be risky like scuba diving and skiing Insolvency of a third party supplier like airline or hotel that accept only non refundable payments Traveling to countries where the risk factor may be higher due to situations like war, terrorist acts, or some sort of natural disaster This coverage is provided but, normally, in exchange of additional premium. Interested proposers can also get separate insurance for the above mentioned situations, which may, at times, be not covered by insurers. However, travel insurers normally do not cover any illness or injury that may have resulted from usage of drug or alcohol. Pregnancy costs are often covered by the insurers if such clients travel within the initial trimester. However, coverage after that period is provided at the discretion of the insurer. The amount of coverage that a person needs in case of travel insurance is dependent on factors like duration of journey, and the proposer's age. If the stay is a longer one then the required coverage amount will go up and if the proposer is of an advanced age then the coverage amount will need to go up as well. Benefits of Travel Insurance The travel insurance providers often offer useful services and these are available, more often than not, on a round the clock basis. These services include emergency travel assistance and concierge services. Need of Travel Insurance Travel insurance comes in handy especially during international travel. The medical expenses outside India are normally pretty high. There are some countries where the doctors may not check a person if he or she is not covered in a travel insurance policy.
