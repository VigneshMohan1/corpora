These loans even though are part of primary sector lending, some banks are slightly skeptical about these due to past records of waivers etc. However, if adequate collateral security is provided and if the soundness of the Project report submitted and the credentials of the entrepreneur are established, Banks will be more than willing to finance. It is in this context, we must negotiate a better rate for our entrepreneur.

However, we see that, there is a definite change in attitude when our so called "Uneducated" is supported by professional consultants. This treatment by the banks is again rooted in their level of confidence that they have in our entrepreneur.

But, I can say, which thorough screening of committed organic farmers, the banks must extend loans as seed money with low interest rate. I am happy to indicate many software professionals ventured into organic farming in the recent past (in and around Bengaluru). They are of the opinion that farming can be as lucrative as software profession. We are giving services and let you know the outcome in a couple of years. Aditi Organic Certifications Pvt.

It is pity thing my side as I am a Agriculture Graduate and trained Agriclinics and Agribussiness programme , which is funding by NABARD -Scheme to un-employed agriculture graduates to setting up private Agri services to the farmers. I am unable to get the minimum amount also to my own small extent of 4 Acres land, even crop loan also not availed by the bankers. If any consultant is there helping in this regard to get sanction the bank loan and subsidy, Please inform to email: bhaskarponnathota@gmail.com Reply With Quote March 25th, 2014 #28 editorialteam Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 1,063 Mr. Sudharsan, Yoogakshema Orchards and Farms says- I never look at bank for any support for agri purpose because they offer only lip service.

Ltd says- There should be uniform policy on agri loans; micro-financing organizations such as rural banks, Self Help Groups (SHGs) should be promoted in a big way. More than that we have to shift our farming system from heavy Input based system to self sufficient (zero or minimum input system), then only our farmers will become prosperous.
