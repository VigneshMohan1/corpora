Bhalarao Ramchandra Dhordira,  Vasmar, Hingoli dist, Maharashtra     Sri.Kandula Narasi Reddy, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh     Vermi-Composting Unit     1. Objective : To provide cultural material of the desired species and train farmers and entrepreneurs. To demonstrate practically the production methodology on the unit that will be set up.   2. Location and area of operation :   Suburbs of cities and villages around urban centres can be ideal locations for practice of vermicomposting on a large scale, from the point of view of availability of raw material and marketing of the produce. Unit may also be located in areas with concentration of fruits and vegetables and floriculture units.   3. Project components :   i) Sheds : For a vermi-composting unit, whether small or big, could be of thatched roof supported by bamboo rafters and purlins, wooden trusses and stone pillars. ii) Vermi-beds : Normally the beds are 75 cm - 90 cm thick depending on the provision of filter for drainage of excess water. The entire bed area could be above the ground. iii) Land : About 0.5-1 acre of land will be needed to set up a vermiculture production cum extension centre. Even sub marginal land also will serve the purpose. iv) Buildings & Furniture : In the activity on a large scale on commercial lines, considerable amount may have to be spent on buildings to house the office, store the raw material and finished product, provide minimum accommodation to the personnel. A reasonable amount could also be considered for furnishing the office-cum-stores including the storage racks and other office equipment. v) Seed Stock : Worms @ 350 worms per m 3 of bed space should be adequate to start with and to build up the required population in about two to three cycles. vi) Fencing, Roads/Paths and Water Supply System : The site area needs development for construction of structures and development of roads and pathways for easy movement of hand-drawn trolleys/ wheel barrows for conveying the raw material and the finished products to and from the vermi-sheds. There is also need to plan for a water source, lifting mechanism and a system of conveying and applying the water to the vermi-beds. vii) Machinery : Farm machinery and implements are required for cutting (shredding) the raw material in small pieces, conveying shredded raw material to the vermi-sheds, loading, unloading, collection of compost and such related activities. viii) Transport : For any vermi-composting unit transport arrangement is a must. A large sized unit with about 1000 tonnes per annum capacity may require a tonne capacity mini-truck.   4. Project Cost :   A.
