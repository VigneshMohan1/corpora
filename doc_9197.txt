R.K.ANAND. 9920034885. rkanantha@yahoo.com Hello Mr.Anand, Its is a 2Hp borewell submersible pump. The pump was already running on EB and was erected at 200ft already. We just converted it to run on solar, where The pump delivery @ full rpm when sunlight is powerful and rpm comes down when sunlight decreases (Frequency Decreases). This setup starts around 7 to 7.30AM when sun comes out and runs till 5.45 to 6PM when sun sets. We shall surely get back to you for your requirement.

I am asking all these details to estimate solar pump HP for my bore well. Thank You Dear Santana, Thank you for the enquiry. Please note that you cannot ascertain the pump requirement by comparing another pump installations. Even though keeping pump constant we have lot of other variables which will vary site to site. Its an experts and a professional's job to size solar water pumping solution which is left well to the safe hands. In your case if you can share your borewell details, I shall be glad to advice you suitably.
