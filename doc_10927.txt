Go to the shop SK Agri Consultant – promotes medicinal crop cultivation Home SK Agri Consultant – promotes medicinal crop cultivation Promotes medicinal crop cultivation and multi cropping to secure better earnings “Medicinal herbs have high demand both in India and abroad,” shares Mr. Shantanu Kumar Karamkar, Consultant, SK Agri Consultant. He extends consultancy services to farmers for medicinal plant cultivation. Good quality and bulk quantity buyers are not readily and regularly available. “Too much gap is seen in demand and supply ratio,” he says. Mr. Karamkar owns a farm where he is growing crops mainly stevia and safed musli. He shares, “Many buyers in India buy stevia from Mumbai , Delhi, Indore and Chennai etc. Buyers are companies manufacturing biscuits, chocolate, toothpaste, and cold drinks etc. International companies are on look out for good quality and bulk quantity stevia.” The price of stevia varies on the percentage content of stevioside. “15 % stevioside contents produce can get a price Rs. 200/- kg and above,” informs Mr. Karmakar. However regardless of the percentage content the average price ranges around Rs 150/- kg. Medicinal plants having high demand are safed musli / stevia / glorisa superva / sarpagandha etc. Speaking of medicinal plants high in demand and low in supply Mr. Karmakar says, “As per global market scenario, these herbs are safed musli, stevia, sarpagandha, glorisa superva, aswagandha, gugal, kutki, sandal wood plantation etc.” He also promotes multi-cropping for farmers for ‘regular/periodical income source’. Example of multi-tier cropping would be tomatoes, onions and marigolds. Another example is the tropical multi-tier system where coconut occupies the upper tier, banana the middle tier, and pineapple, ginger or a leguminous fodder, or herbs occupy the lowest tier like safed musli, brahmi, vegetable and amla or alternatively amla, safed musli and stevia etc. “Multi cropping also uses the practice of sowing a fast-growing crop with a slow-growing crop, so that the fast-growing crop is harvested before the slow-growing crop starts to mature,” adds Mr. Karmakar. For a farmer to be able to earn all the year round he shares illustrations as; first he can choose a short duration crop (45 days to 3 month),secondly medium duration crop (60-90 days) third would be long duration (one year) and finally very long duration ones such as amla, sandal wood plantation, wood purpose trees etc. The short duration crop is harvested before the medium duration crop starts to mature, and after which comes the long duration ones and so on continuing to grow accordingly. The basic difference between inter-cropping and multi-cropping is that in the first case there are only 2 crops however in the second case there are more than two. The first is targeted to minimize risk of crop failure and maximize earnings while the latter is to improve the yield. Mr. Karmakar says that he is willing to help a farmer in marketing the produce, “If farmers contact me I will help them for marketing.” He suggests farmer to adopt organic cultivation for getting good price. “Also it is essential to make groups of farmers crop-wise for bulk quantity selling of produce,” he adds, “Don’t think about the produce immediately after the harvesting, maintain a little stock for some time and continue to check the market price.” The future plans of the company includes organizing crops awareness program, training camp, seminars etc. in interior villages with the aid of specialists and to contact big land holders to start cultivation for long time crops such as sandal wood plantation, fruits, medicinal farming and make greenery for good health.
