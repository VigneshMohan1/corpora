According to Ethnologue, India is considered to be home to 461 languages, out of which 14 have been reported to be extinct. But still there is not a single Indian language that is spoken across its length and breadth. Hindi is spoken by a majority of North Indians, but it is not a popular means of communication in the southern part of India. Similarly, South Indian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam are not understood by the people of North India. For the convenience of people, the Constitution of India has recognised 22 languages as the official languages of India. These are known as Scheduled Languages and constitute the major languages of the country. India Language Map provides detailed information about these languages listed in Schedule VIII of the Constitution and spoken in different parts of the country. The list of some of the Indian languages includes: Sanskrit Hindi English Gujarati - Language of Gujarat and Union Territories of Dadar and Nagar Haveli Punjabi - The official language of Punjab Bengali- The state language of West Bengal Assamese - Official language of Assam Dogri, Urdu - The language of Jammu and Kashmir Oriya - The state language of state of Odisha Marathi - Language of Maharashtra Kannada - The official language of Karnataka Tamil - The state language of Tamil Nadu Telugu - It is the official language of Andhra Pradesh.

Besides these, there are other languages, which are spoken by large masses but have still not acquired the status of Scheduled Languages of India. These languages spoken by regional people are known as regional languages of India. These include Rajasthani, Haryanvi, Bhili, Gondi and Tulu among others. Some Indian languages are not widely spoken and have been given the status of minority languages. Mahl and Portuguese languages come under this category.
