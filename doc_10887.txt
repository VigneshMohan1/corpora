Srinivas Kumar and Mr. Hrishikesh Manian are the founders of RenXSol. The company was established in 2012. Both founders are veterans of the Indian solar industry. A need to address food and agricultural processing/storage by solar drying, which was not extensively tackled by the solar industry gave way to the emergence of the company. It was established with an aim to solve these issues with an engineered approach. Located at Bangalore, Karnataka. RenXSol is the system integrator in the picture of providing solutions. “The solar collector, a key component is sourced from abroad; the solution however is designed and integrated/installed by us, as we are familiar with on-site challenges in India,” shares Mr. Manian. The key products for agricultural industry are solar air heating/drying systems, which are useful in storing the products for longer periods of time. This technique protects against inclement weather, rodent/pests/animals and decreased use of hard-to-find labor. Additionally where wood/charcoal/diesel is used, it offers a tremendous advantage as solar energy is free. These systems are modular in design and hence can be custom-made for different end-user applications. The solar drying systems channelize air-flow through the solar collectors, thereby increasing temperatures to significantly greater than ambient. In food processing higher temperature to replace steam can also be reached. The drying process is thus done in a controlled manner. “The drying system is very useful in tobacco, grapes, vegetable dehydration like onions, tomatoes, cashew nut, elaichi, coffee/tea leaves and other sensitive crops,” Mr. Manian adds. Solar cold storage solutions are also provided by RenXsol to farmers. These systems are modular and can be fit on existing roof or can be designed with a chamber. Cost of the same can range from a lakh to a few lakhs of rupees depending on the scale of operation required by the farmer or industry. Subsidy from the government is available for these projects depending on the scale of the installation. The target customers of the company range from co-operatives to small to midsize agri and processing industries. The company aims to provide more technology-enabled solar energy solutions to the agri industry in the coming times.  Mr. Hrishikesh Manian holds a master’s degree in Materials Science and Engineering from University Of Cincinnati, USA. He has been a technology entrepreneur for the past decade in the advance materials and solar industries. Our Correspondent Contact Details: Mr. Hrishikesh Manian, Director, RenXSol ECotech Pvt. Ltd.
