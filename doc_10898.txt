Go to the shop SAFS Organic Enterprises – solar solution for pest control Home SAFS Organic Enterprises – solar solution for pest control Safe and eco-friendly solar solution for pest control “I understood from many farmers that in olden days Light Trap mechanism was used to manage the pests in the farm,” shares Mr. Abdul Kadhar, Founder and Director, SAFS Organic Enterprises which led to the development of solar powered insect trapper. The device is used as an accessory for integrated pest management. “It is my own invention that came through after 3.5 years of research and design,” he says, “We have filed patent and design registration for the product.” It is sold as SAFS Organic-Solar Insect Light Trap. “We made many prototypes with high power yellow LED and tried it in different field,” shares Mr. Kadhar. It was made semi-automatic with common UV and finally came up with the solar version fully automated which took a total of about 2 years. It operates by microprocessor based simple logic software and uses specific light wavelength technology. The product is designed to be fully charged within 5 hours and give back-up to 4-5 days as per the auto logic built. Solar powered insect trapper becomes operational automatically as the sun sets. “It is uses multiple algorithms built by our software and downloaded to the chip. It uses solar and outside climate as sensors for understanding the environment,” he says. The device is assured a minimum of 3 years operational lifetime. The device is claimed to trap the pests that are harmful for the crops and not the good pests. “We studied the behavior of many beneficial insects like honeybee, butterflies etc., also studied the behavior of economically impacting pest like borer, sucking pest, beetles etc,” explains Mr. Kadhar and adds, “This data helped us to build those logic in software and load it in the device. It can capture all types of flying moths as well. We tested it at citrus fruit orchard in Thenkasi Area (Thirunelveli dist, Tamil Nadu).” Light has to be there in the crop field from nursery till harvest to obtain the maximum control of insects. It is recommended to keep the device in the field always so that it gets charged and discharged every day. “The device is designed to operate in all the climatic conditions. During rain and winter the pest activity will be less and so catch will be less too. However no changes are required accept when it rains if the bowl fills with excess water, just reduce to 2.5 liter level in the bowl,” informs Mr. Kadhar. Various farmers assert the device being very helpful for example watermelon farmers claimed the device helped control all borers; KVK Cheiyyar, paddy farmer states that device helped them to cut down 2 complete spray for paddy and citrus farmer in Thirukaunkundram, Kangipuram dist said the device captures about 150 – 3 adult moths daily. “At Present we manufacture only from Puducherry and send across all the country,” he shares. The total annual production is about 5000 units at present. The device does not require after-sales services however if the device is not kept under the sun for long duration then the life of battery would come down. The company plans to increase the annual production to about 60,000 units per year. To aid this plan the company looks forward for strong finance, marketing and branding support. “We want to support our farmers with simple sustainable solution products with very low cost,” shares Mr. Kadhar and adds, “We want next generation of our kids to eat less poisonous chemical foods at least 1% lower.” Contact details- SAFS Organic Enterprises 169, Vazhudavur Main Road, Puducherry, India – 605009 Ph: 0413 – 2271915, Mob: 094485 91915 9688883368 (Tamil Nadu) / 9035375442 (Bangalore) Email: safs.orgmm@gmail.com Web: www.safsorganic.com Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > SAFS Organic Enterprises – solar solution for pest control Related – articles, consultants, downloads SAFS Organic Enterprises Saravana Kumar talks on solar system solution Anusha Enterprises – solar power fencing Infinite Solar – solar lanterns You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
