Go to the shop Pacific Herbs Agro Farms – Supplies medicinal and aromatic herbs Home Pacific Herbs Agro Farms – Supplies medicinal and aromatic herbs Supplies medicinal and aromatic herbs, and aromatic oils Pacific Herbs Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd. was established in 2004 by Mr. Ashok Kumar Jonwal, managing director, and his wife. The company also provides planting materials of all herbs, and citrus saplings – orange, sweet lemon and lemon. Pacific Herbs provides agri services that include site survey, consultancy, project feasibility report, contract farming, land lease and joint venture for aromatic oil, bio diesel and medicinal and aromatic plants project. The company is located in Nagpur. Speaking about the initial challenges faced by the company, Mr. Jonwal says, “The initial challenge was finding potential and regular buyers for the herbs and aromatic oils,” says Mr. Jonwal, adding, “As per my study and knowledge, I was sure that this field is having good potential and scope in future.” Product Demand Speaking about mucuna pruriens, Mr. Jonwal says, “At present we are not cultivating mucuna. The rates are so low (Rs 25 to 30 per kg) that it cannot be cultivated due to high cost of cultivation. We had order for mucuna at Rs. 70/kg from one exporter from Delhi, but now there is no demand from him.” Mr. Jonwal informs that coleus gives good returns. “It gives good return, approximately Rs.50 to 70 thousand per acre per crop. Only the dry roots of the plant are sold. The shoots are only used as planting material. The demand for coleus is only growing. Hence the rates are going high and high,” he says. Speaking about the challenges of medicinal plants business, Mr. Jonwal says, “There is a good demand for many herbs but it is difficult to spot them.” Contract Farming The company undertakes contract farming for a large number of medicinal and herbal plants. “We produce the herbs as per the buyer’s requirement,” maintains Mr. Jonwal. It provides buy back guarantee to the farmers. Some of the plants offered on contract manufacturing include aswagandha, coleus, tulsi, and gloriosa superba. Future Plans In future, the company plans to expand the coleus plantation up to 200 acres and establish 10 manufacturing units of essential oil along with minimum 30 acres of plantation for each unit. Advising newcomers entering the medicinal plants business, Mr. Jonwal says, “One should not take this as the only source of income initially. They should research and conduct survey regarding the demand and supply of the herbs. Most importantly they should look for potential buyers of the herbs.” Mr. Jonwal is a graduate and an ex Indian Air Force Sergeant, where he served as electronic engineer for 15 years.
