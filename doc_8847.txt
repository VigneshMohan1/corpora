Guidelines & Other informations ( English ) / ( Hindi ) Strengthening / Developement of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading & Standardisation With a view to induce large investment in the development of marketing infrastructure, the Ministry has formulated a scheme for “Development/Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading and Standardization” during 2004. Under this scheme investment subsidy is provided on the capital cost of general or commodity specific infrastructure for marketing of agricultural commodities and for strengthening and modernization of existing agricultural markets, wholesale, rural and periodic or in tribal areas. The scheme is reform linked, to be implemented in those States/UTs that amend the APMC Act wherever required to allow setting up of agricultural markets in private and cooperative sectors. Under the scheme, back ended subsidy @ 25% of capital cost of the project is provided in all States and @ 33.3% of capital cost in case of NE States, hilly areas and SC/ST entrepreneurs. In respect of infrastructure projects of State Agencies, there is no upper ceiling on subsidy to be provided under the scheme. Agricultural Marketing being the State subject the Directorate has only an advisory role so far as improvement/development of marketing system is concerned. In the field of grading and quality assurance also, Directorate endeavors to involve State authorities more and more to make it consumer/public oriented. Being a central coordinating organization, Directorate is actively associated with the development in agricultural marketing in both State and National level by introducing various reform initiatives of Government of India. Since Inception of the scheme up to 31-12-2012, a total number of 8087 marketing Infrastructure projects have been sanctioned and subsidy of Rs 782.14 crores has been released. Guidelines & more information ( English ) / ( Hindi ) Marketing Research & Information Network This Central Sector Scheme was sanctioned by the Ministry Of Agriculture in March, 2000. The objective of the scheme is to establish a nationwide information network for speedy collection and dissemination of market data for its efficient and timely utilization; to ensure flow of regular and reliable data to the producers, traders and consumers to derive maximum advantage out of their sales and purchases, and to increase efficiency in marketing by effective improvement in the existing market information system. As on March 2013, more than 3200 markets have been covered under the network and market information on arrivals and prices from more than 2100 markets are received regularly in respect of 400 commodities and 3000 varieties daily covering all major agricultural and horticultural produce. The AGMARKNET portal is continuously being enriched with other information related to agricultural marketing for the benefit of farmers and other market users. ‘AGMARKNET’ is a unique live portal on agricultural commodities anywhere in the world, technically supported by a high capacity Central server and the programming capabilities of the NIC and the data is fed into the system in a decentralized mode through the voluntary cooperation of mandi staff. This is acceptable since the aim of the network is to keep farmers and other market functionaries informed of price and market related information. The portal is in public domain and anybody can access information from the portal as per their requirement. The portal is becoming popular as the information related to different aspects of marketing. The market information from the portal being broadcasted by various Television News Channels and published in News Papers for befit if farmers and other stakeholders. Efforts are also being made for dissemination of market information in association with other service providers like IKSL, NOKIA and IIT, Kanpur (BSNL Telecom Center of Excellence)etc. through SMS and voice mode to the farmers and other beneficiaries. As on March 2013 around 50lakh beneficiaries are getting Marketing information in SMS or Voice mode in their mobile handsets. for further information (English) / (Hindi) National Agricultural Market Atlas Terminal Market Complex सहयोग Grading And Standardisation of Agricultural and Allied Produce Quality standards for agricultural commodities are framed based on their intrinsic quality. Food safety factors are being incorporated in the standards to compete in World trade. Standards are being harmonised with international standards keeping in view the WTO requirements. Certification of agricultural commodities is carried out for the benefit of producer/manufacturer and consumer. Certification of adulteration prone commodities viz. Butter, Ghee, Vegetable Oils, Ground-Spices, Honey, Wheat Atta etc. is very popular. Blended Edible Vegetable Oils and Fat Spread are compulsorily required to be certified under Agmark. The Certification mark under the Agricultural Produce (Grading & Marking) Act is popularly known as "AGMARK". Grading is carried out in accordance with the standards notified, following meticulous procedure of sampling, testing, packaging, marking and sealing as per the instructions issued under the Act and Rules.

It aims at making extension system farmer driven and farmer accountable by way of new institutional arrangements for technology dissemination in the form of an Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) at district level to operationalize the extension reforms. ATMA has active participation of farmers/farmer-groups, NGOs,KrishiVigyanKendras (KVKs), Panchayati Raj Institutions and other stakeholders operating at district level and below. Release of funds under ATMA scheme is based on State Extension Work Plans (SEWPs) prepared by the State Governments. Allocation of resources for activities related to extension is linked to number of farm households and Blocks. At present, the Scheme is under implementation in 614 districts in 28 States and 3 UTs in the country. In order to promote key reforms under the Scheme, ATMA Cafeteriam, 2010 continues to support activities in line with the following policy parameters: Multi-agency Extension Strategies : At least, 10% of allocation on recurring activities at district level is to be used through non-governmental sector viz.
