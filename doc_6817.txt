Ashray Akruti Ashray Akruti One Comment Shama Fatmi April 10, 2010 at 2:27 pm Dear Madam / Sir Namaskar I take this opportunity first to introduce my organisation samajik shaikshanik vikas kendra (SSVK) and its activities. We are a grassroots organisation operating in one of the most poverty endemic pockets spread over five districts Madhubani, Darbhanga, Madhepura,Saharsa and Supaul of North Bihar ( India). We primarily work with below poverty line Mushar families(Sheduled Caste) who constitute the lowliest of the low even among the dalits. In addition commitment also lies with other below poverty line groups coming from other scheduled caste groups and depressed backward classes from other districts of Bihar and Jharkhand. The organisation stands committed to the effective empowerment of its socially, politically and economically marginalised target group. For further details, you can visit us at our website: http://www.ssvk.org To complete our projects and commitment, we welcome your financial as well as other resources. All donations/contributions to SSVK India will be eligible to tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. SSVK receives Foreign Donation through our Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Looking forward to hearing from you.
