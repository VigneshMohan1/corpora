For Rabi (Sowing November to January) i) Deficiency in closing figures for South – West Monsoon (30th September). ii) Serious depletion in level of Ground Water compared to figures for “normal years”. iii) Fall in the level of Reservoirs compared to figures for the corresponding period in the “normal years” – indication of poor recharge following SW Monsoon. iv) Indication of marked soil moisture stress. v) Rise in price of fodder. vi) Increased deployment of water through tankers (For Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry the crucial period is North East Monsoon – October to December). Other Seasons � For areas like Gujarat, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and North Interior Karnataka the crucial period is March / April when due to chronic hydrological drought, many areas develop acute scarcity of Drinking Water. � For specific states and particular crops there are particular times of years when progress of rains is of special significance e.g. February rains in Kerala for plantation crops.
