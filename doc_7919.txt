Kurtis Mason Administrator of Trademarks and Licensing Phone: 405-744-6238 kurtis.mason@okstate.edu     Licensing Information Oklahoma State University benefits from public recognition of its name, symbols, logos, and other identifying marks. These marks give a unifying image, which is critical to establishing a visual presence within the world of university communities. This image becomes identified with the quality of OSU’s programs, products, and services and distinguishes its programs from other universities. Oklahoma State University has registered the names, logos, and trademarks of the university with the Patent and Trademark Office of the United States as well as the Oklahoma Secretary of State. Products bearing those marks and distributed for resale or used for other promotional purposes are subject to the licensing policies of the University. The University has delegated the responsibility for administration of these policies to the Office of Trademarks and Licensing located in the Office of the Legal Counsel. The University’s rights to its marks are governed by federal, state, and common laws. These laws place an obligation on the University to avoid consumer confusion and require that the use of any marks be monitored to avoid losing exclusive control. The mission of the Office of Trademarks and Licensing is to ensure (1) proper use of those trademarks, service marks, logos, and insignias that have come to be associated with Oklahoma State University; (2) generate income to support and enhance the scholastic missions of Oklahoma State University; and (3) protect the university’s reputation, good name and image by permitting only appropriate uses and assuring that only quality products bear the institution’s name, initials or marks.
