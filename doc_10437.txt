Go to the shop Mango & Guava Orchards Home Mango & Guava Orchards Practicing Surgeon keeps his agriculture connect alive by maintaining Guava and Mango Farms in Erragadda near Hyderabad Dr. Prapul Reddy Dr. Prapul Reddy was born in an agricultural family. Today, by profession he is a surgeon (doctor) practicing at Hyderabad but retains his roots in agriculture alive through farming Guava and Mango at his ancestral property. The farm is located in Erragadda near Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh state. Guava was the first crop grown around 1.5 tonnes and mango was grown around 40-60 tonnes. Dr. Prapul Reddy says “Mango and Guava were grown first in my farm. Mango will suit most of the climatic conditions. Among all cultivation, Mango cultivation is easy when compared to other plants, as it provides high density plantation. It requires moderate water. Usually after July or August, we start regular pruning and fertilizing with cow dung and chemical fertilizers. At the time of flowering, pesticides will be sprayed as prescribed by agriculture department.’’ “I sell Mango and Guava in local market or north India, mainly Nagpur, Amaravathi and Nanded. I sell Guava in the local market. Fifty days back, I started growing Guar Gum in 4 acres which started giving good yield. It will take another one month to get seed. I am expecting good yield,’’ adds Dr. Prapul.
