Inadequate hygiene training, and/or instruction and supervision of all people involved in food related activities pose a potential threat to the safety of food and its suitability for consumption. Awareness and responsibilities:  Food hygiene training is fundamentally important. All personnel should be aware of their role and responsibility in protecting food from contamination or deterioration. Food handlers should have the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them to handle food hygienically. Those who handle strong cleaning chemicals or other potentially hazardous chemicals should be instructed in safe handling techniques. Training programs Factors to take into account in assessing the level of training required include: ·         The nature of the food, in particular its ability to sustain growth of pathogenic or spoilage micro organisms; ·         The manner in which the food is handled and packed, including the probability of contamination; the extent and nature of processing or further preparation before final consumption; ·         The conditions under which the food will be stored and ·         The expected length of time before consumption. Instruction and supervision Periodic assessments of the effectiveness of training and instruction programs will be made as well as routine supervision and checks to ensure that procedures are being carried out effectively. Managers and supervisors of food processes will be trained to have the necessary knowledge of food hygiene principles and practices to be able to judge potential risks and take the necessary action to remedy deficiencies. Refresher Training Training programs will be routinely reviewed and updated where necessary. Systems should be in place to ensure that food handlers remain aware of all procedures necessary to maintain the safety and suitability of food.   Home About Us Certification Training HACCP Hygiene awareness News Enquiries Photo Gallery Clientele Copyright © 2014 Official website of National Centre for HACCP Certification, Govt. of Kerala.
