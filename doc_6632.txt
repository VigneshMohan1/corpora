NAF's professional development ensures that teachers and academy directors are equipped to deliver up-to-date instruction and content in their academy theme; course objectives are met and teachers implement NAF Curriculum with maximum effectiveness; and essential components of the NAF model – partnerships that engage stakeholders from the business and civic sectors – are in place and generating the necessary resources to support academy students and teachers. NAF provides professional development through technical assistance, online resources, webinars, in-person training sessions, and conferences. Annual Conference The National Academy Foundation holds an annual professional development conference, NAF Next. The 2015 conference will be held in Anaheim, California from Sunday, July 19 through Wednesday, July 22 . View presentations from past conferences here.   As a reminder, the travel policy for the conference has changed. For 2015, NAF will cover full room cost rather than offer travel support for eligible academies to ensure the highest quality conference experience.    Technology Fellows Fourteen academy educators have been selected to take part in the NAF Verizon Technology Innovation Pilot. Fellows will learn how to infuse technology into instruction from experts with the International Society for Technology in Education ( ISTE ). The central goal of this initiative is to increase our network’s capacity to use integrated technology and to improve technology use in the NAF curriculum. Work-Based Learning Innovation Fellows Fifteen academy educators have been selected to take part in the first WBL Innovation Fellows Lab.  These fellows will share original and exceptional WBL practices from their academies. The goal of this initiative is for the fellows to share presentations and co-develop specific tools and strategies related to WBL that other academies across the network might benefit from learning. Online Collaboration The NAF Community features searchable forums where users can connect and share resources with peers and learn from each other. These forums will make it easier to find the answers to burning questions. Webinars NAF produces a series of webinars designed for continuous improvement for NAF academies. NAF academies can access the 2014-2015 calendar of events through the Academy Support Hub .     ShareThis For Teachers & Administrators NAF Curriculum Professional Development Resources Assessments & Certification Quality Center Work-Based Learning Center Copyright © 2012 National Academy Foundation.
