Located at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu P. Damodarasamy Sanjay India Agro Solutions (SIAS), a partnership firm established in 2007, turned     into a company in 2013. Mr. P. Damodarasamy is the director of this Coimbatore-based company. Apart from the director, Mr. Suresh and Mr. D. Prabhu are the other promoters of the company. SIAS believes in not just providing solutions to the farmer’s problems but also create an environment where there is no scope for a problem to arise. Green house farming, dairy farming, and less-water consuming agriculture giving maximum yield are the main areas SIAS specializes in. This includes establishment of green houses, dairy farms and goat farms on turnkey basis, consultancy and implementation of ideas for hi-tech agriculture, providing solutions to farmers. Drip irrigation and herbal plantation, floriculture and export advisory are certain methods through which the company makes hi-tech agriculture accessible to farmers. SIAS has erected more than 46,000 Sq meters of green house. It has also established dairy farms totaling to 1850 cows and buffaloes on turnkey basis. “We have a clientele of about 134 hi-tech farmers as our clients. We have tied up project funding from nationalized banks for total value of Rs.147.50 Crores totaling 69 Projects consisting of green house, dairy farms, goat farms and hi-tech agriculture,” Mr. Damodarasamy adds. SIAS like various other companies has to constantly face marketing challenges posed by the industry. To meet and surpass these challenges, the company continually remains in touch with local procurement agencies and institutional buyers like colleges, schools, hospitals and industrial units to market milk products. They also contact leading agri produce outlets for vegetables and fruits supplies. “We tie up the buyer with the seller, where there is no local requirement source for the market on the internet and give leads to the farmer and as needed we act on behalf of the farmer for selling and collection of proceeds” shares Mr. Damodarasamy. Company’s work and success are reflected in various success stories that took place in Tamil Nadu owing to their services. One such story is that of Mr. Varadaraj who started a dairy to provide milk to the students of his school for the poor, increasing the strength of students to 2700 in three years. The surplus from the dairy is sold to nearby areas thus providing him more income. Another such story is that of a farmer who started growing jasmine as per SIAS’s suggestion who now exports the same to Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore.  SIAS plans to continue creating such success stories and promoting green house cultivation and dairy farming and hi-tech farming methods in the future.
