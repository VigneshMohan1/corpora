As a matter of fact, the population of Jharkhand had witnessed an entirely unprecedented and astonishing hype during a spree lasting for ten years commencing from the year 1991 continuing till the year 2001. This amplification in the Jharkhand population had been recorded to be an astounding 23.19 % that is truly unbelievable. What is even more unsettling about this abrupt augmentation in the population across Jharkhand is the fact that the entire nation of India had only undergone an increment of 21.19% which is less compared to the sole state of Jharkhand. Another weird trend that has come under the limelight is the sex ratio, which is necessarily the number of females per thousand males in the state, has also gone up. This elaborately illustrates that the number of females inhabiting the state are increasing compared to the number of males in the state. Although, the alteration is very minute, from 922 to 941, in a span of ten years, yet large enough to get noticed. The most satiating and gratifying thing about the population at Jharkhand is the fact that the percentage of the literate persons residing in the state have experienced a truly remarkable ascend. The data extracted from the census of 2001 that supports this theory reads that the literacy has risen from 41.39% to 54.13% which truly deserves a humongous round of applause.
