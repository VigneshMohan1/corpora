General Information about the Organization:-</p> <p>“Garia Sathi” is devoted to the growth, development and rehabilitation of the children of our society with natural negations and various challenges.<br /> Operating on a very humble level, we are fortunate to receive some invaluable service from some local experts. For a Govt. registered Organization we are now striving towards mass awareness, social support and corporate patronage for our cause.<br /> We intend to drive home in to the minds of the People that these challenges can be made easy to some extent with early detection and proper care and that in no way bad parenting, or evil stars have any influence on these challenged individuals. Our basic premise is to work with and for the under-privileged and the BPL population who constitute the major portion of the rural populace With this awareness mission on hand we are on a fast track to cover whole of Kolkata and aspire to go national down the years. </p> <p>We have been blessed with a world of colors, fragrances and sounds – and most of us are blessed with the sense to feel and experience these shades of life. But, there are a few whose lives are dark and silent – who are unable to see or feel or hear life as we take for granted. These challenged souls are fighting for a ray of hope – a hope to live!<br /> The pain, the agony and the helplessness of the mentally or physically challenged people are unbearable. Sometime, we, the privileged ones, take pity on them and utter “How sad! God help them” or such similar words of sympathy.<br /> What is really sad is that we fail to understand the challenged &#8211; “They need Empathy not Sympathy”. </p> <p>Garia Sathi – Who are we?</p> <p>Garia Sathi, a non-profit organization has taken upon its shoulder to work with the challenged children who belong to the villages and Below Poverty Line (BPL) population. They are even unable to have a square meal a day, leave alone pay for their special treatment.<br /> Presently, Garia Sathi has employed a dedicated and efficient of audiologist, speech therapist, psychologists, psychiatrists, physiotherapists and special educators dealing with MR &#038; HI cases. They are treating, training and educating a number of physically challenged children and adults belonging to </p> <p>BPL and under privileged families who require hearing aids, artificial limbs, wheel chairs, crutches, balance-shoes, chairs designed for different kinds of disabilities. Many require aids but do not have the means to buy those instruments while others require treatment, training &#038; education.<br /> Garia Sathi- OUR INSPIRATION<br /> Human Society comprises Homo Sapiens of Normal, exceptional and abnormal natures. Whoever it is, to simply exist in this jet world of competition it is almost impossible to exist without proper understanding&#038; knowledge, learning efficiency of ones own. These when coupled with the latent potential of individual renders him “SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE’. We intend to strive to extend a square field to these children.<br /> The very concept originated in the mind one of our member whose daughter a victim of hearing impairment since birth.

To bring a ray of hope to the lives of Autistic &#038; mentally challenged children<br /> ? To guide the challenged people towards a better and meaningful way of live<br /> ? We intend to train these children and make them self- sufficient for all walks of life so that they do not need to depend on others and can successfully create a standing of their own. They need our empathy not sympathy. They should be made to inculcate within themselves a sense of self – respect &#038; dignity and create their own worth, when the sun will rise for them alone.<br /> Garia Sathi – Our Vission</p> <p>• We aspire to make the challenged children of today facilities of tomorrow so that they can render assistance to somebody else and make them selves sufficient enough to shoulder the responsibilities of making India a super power.<br /> • We dream of a nation where the people will be intertwined &#038; interrelated where no one will be a burden or obligation for the other.<br /> Garia Sathi &#8211; Our Modus Operandi<br /> • Registration.<br /> • Identification.<br /> • Documentation.<br /> • Counseling.<br /> • Training Initiation.<br /> • Deployment of sequential practice with the expert’s advice.<br /> • Regular securitizations of equipments &#038; patient suitability &#038; adaptability.<br /> • Feedback.<br /> • Formal education.<br /> • Initiative for mainstream retrieval. </p> <p>Garia Sathi &#8211; Areas of Operations</p> <p>?

These camps also build awareness in the immediate community and help people understand the needs and requirements of their challenged family member or neighbors.<br /> Through the awareness camps, Garia Sathi aims to provide guidance and solution for a better life for the challenged people, enabling them to protect their self-esteem. </p> <p>Extra Curricular Activities at Garia Sathi </p> <p>?

This cannot be sustained for long without your help and support. And it would be a great injustice on our part to let down those, whom we promised to help.</p> <p>We are in dire need of funds. </p> <p> Our immediate need is a larger place to house our institute, as the present house is unable to accommodate the number of children pouring in for help. Our main objective is to enable the needy and under-privileged children to overcome the disabilities that Mother Nature has thrust upon them. We, at Garia Sathi, need your support to provide that ray of hope and guidance to these children.<br /> We would be ever grateful and appreciate your help in support for this noble cause.</p> <p> For Garia Sathi</p> <p> ( Sumitra Ganguly)<br /> Principal of the Institution </p> <p>This post was submitted by <a href="http://gariasathi.org" rel="nofollow">debaprasad chakraborty</a>.</p><div class="crp_related"><hr><br><h3>Related Posts:</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/winner-society-for-disabled-care-and-women-empowermentwinner-society/" class="crp_title">Winner Society</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/child-help-foundation/" class="crp_title">Child Help Foundation</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/sharon-society-of-pondicherry/" class="crp_title">sharon society of pondicherry</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/bhartiya-shaikshik-sansthan/" class="crp_title">Bhartiya Shaikshik Sansthan</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/the-doctors-united-charitable-trust/" class="crp_title">The Doctors United Charitable Trust</a></li></ul> <br><hr><div style="clear:both"></div></div> 0 Sushil Parida Action for Better Living and Environment (ABLE) http://ngogateway.com/?p=13607 2014-07-09T07:58:33Z 2014-07-09T07:58:33Z Action for Better Living and Environment (ABLE in acronym) – a non-profit, apolitical, non-sectarian, Non-Government Voluntary Development Organisation came in to existence way back in 1991 by a group of development sensitive committed local youths with the vision of self reliant caste and classless society based on equity, gender justice, compassion, free from hunger, starvation [&#8230;]<div class="crp_related"><hr><br><h3>Related Posts:</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/score-society-for-community-organization-and-rural-education-2/" class="crp_title">Society for Community Organization and Rural Education&hellip;</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/iaeet/" class="crp_title">IAEET</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/incord-foundation/" class="crp_title">Incord Foundation</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/children-and-youth-development-association-cyda/" class="crp_title">CHILDREN AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION-CYDA</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/incord-foundation-2/" class="crp_title">Incord Foundation</a></li></ul> <br><hr><div style="clear:both"></div></div> <p>Action for Better Living and Environment (ABLE in acronym) – a non-profit, apolitical, non-sectarian, Non-Government Voluntary Development Organisation came in to existence way back in 1991 by a group of development sensitive committed local youths with the vision of self reliant caste and classless society based on equity, gender justice, compassion, free from hunger, starvation and exploitation; maintaining harmony between human living and surround environment for sustainable development in participatory manner.</p> <p>ABLE’s mission is to bring about improved quality of life of poor, marginalized, downtrodden and vulnerable sections in neglected and un-served areas by facilitating people centered, eco-compatible, participatory, sustainable developmental process.

Interfaith was formed in 1979 by a small group of local faith communities that wanted to pool their resources to better serve the needs of the homeless and near homeless in our communities.</p> <p>From it&#8217;s beginning, Interfaith has developed a unique, comprehensive system of services that helped people in extreme need to stabilize their lives, and then progress to their highest level of self-sufficiency.</p> <p>All of Interfaith&#8217;s programs are designed to help people help themselves &#8212; to offer a hand up, not a handout. Many thousands of lives have been changed for the better, and many lives saved, through the collective efforts of Interfaith and our community over the last 30+ years.</p> <p>This post was submitted by <a href="http://www.interfaithservices.org" rel="nofollow">Larry Christensen</a>.</p><div class="crp_related"><hr><br><h3>Related Posts:</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/holly-human-development-organization-pakistan-2/" class="crp_title">Holly Human Development Organization Pakistan</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/shaloom-foundation-pakistan/" class="crp_title">Shaloom Foundation Pakistan</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/rwenzori-christian-foundation-for-the-needy-communities/" class="crp_title">Rwenzori Christian Foundation For The Needy Communities</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/shaloom-foundation-pakistan-2/" class="crp_title">Shaloom Foundation Pakistan</a></li><li><a href="http://ngogateway.com/organization/south-sudan-community-change-agency/" class="crp_title">South Sudan Community Change Agency</a></li></ul> <br><hr><div style="clear:both"></div></div> 33.1248016 -117.0915909 0
