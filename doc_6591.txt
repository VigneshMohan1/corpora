Bioinformatics aims to bring the biologists, statisticians and computer scientists together from the point of view of system biology approach to understand the biological phenomenon through innovative applications of statistics and computer science. It entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data. The field of Bioinformatics focuses on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques (e.g., pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning algorithms, and visualization) which gives the opportunity to quickly and efficiently study heap of genomic information, chemical structure and other biological data. It uses biological databases to solve various problems and mysteries to uncover the wealth of hidden biological information and enhance the standard of life for mankind. Bioinformatics has already started showing its profound impact on agricultural research and development.       News Activities Archive This site is viewed by IASRI, Library Avenue, PUSA, New Delhi - 110 012 (INDIA) Phone : 91-11-25847121-24,25841254 (PBX), Fax : 91-11-25841564 Send mail to Webmaster with questions or comments about this web site.
