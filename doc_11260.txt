Selects crops suitable for Rajasthan climate Water scarcity is strength for Mr. Tarnjan Choudhary which actually is problem for many farmers. He prefers to grow crops that need minimum water as Rajasthan has forever issue of water scarcity. He grows medicinal plants and has taken initial steps for pomegranate farming at his 45 acres farmland in Bhimarly village, Barmar district, Rajasthan. In his words, “I am growing two varieties of medicinal plants namely senna and shankhpushpi all over my farm. These plants grow well in less or even no water and gives good return. In addition on experiment basis I have planted 250 saplings of pomegranate in between the farm. Again taking into consideration water issues in my region I am using drip irrigation for pomegranate farming,” he shares. Other reasons for growing senna he says, “It does not require any fertilizer or other farming inputs instead grow on its own and animals do not eat this plant. Further in one year it gives harvest for three times.” At the moment farming is part time business for Mr. Choudhary as he full-time academician. When asked how he learnt about senna crop he shares, “I studied agriculture in 10+2 so I know the ground details on medicinal plants. Later, I read article about the profitable crops in Rajasthan that had positive comments on senna crop. I was inclined towards farming hence searched the internet for more information.” Mr. Choudhary took seeds for senna cultivation from Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Barmar. “We had sown 50 kg seeds in 45 acres,” he adds. Once seeds are sown in the fields it goes on for five years and gives harvest thrice/year. “The plant size is 2.5-3 feet, once cut for harvest it re-grows to its same height in 4 months,” he shares. Senna leaves are having good demand in the market due to its medicinal properties. “The plants is cut leaving one foot stem behind and dried in the shadow. Later after a brisk jolt the leaves are separated. These dried leaves are sold instantly in the market and also its powder has better sales value,” shares Mr. Choudhary. One acre farm yields one quintal senna leaves. “Leaves are sold at Rs. 50/kg. Selling in local market is easy,” he shares. Shankhpushpi medicinal plant is also grown at the farm. It is mostly found as one of the main ingredients in Dabur products. The plant grows independently without any efforts. “It is completely in alliance with the nature of Rajasthan soil and climate. It is sold locally and later is exported. On an average yearly the total yield is 2-3 quintals and is sold at Rs. 16/kg,” shares Mr. Choudhary. “Both these medicinal plants are exported to foreign countries hence the demand is high. If farmers are able to export directly to the buyers then they can get much better price. I am too trying to find direct buyer for senna leaves and shankhpushpi,” he says. While searching for exporters for medicinal plant produce Mr. Choudhary came to know about profitable prospects of organic pomegranates. He says, “Pomegranate farming if done organically has high potential so I decided to take it up on experiment basis. He makes organic fertilizer at the farm itself by mixing cow dung, neem leaves, calotropis (called aakada in hindi) along with two more natural ingredients. “This fertilizer we mix with the soil. Within a month it improves the sapling growth and the taste of the pomegranate is very good as it is 100% chemical free. I bought the saplings from Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Rs. 25/sapling,” he says. Pomegranate sapling needs water hence Mr. Choudhary stores rain water and uses drip irrigation. He says, “I use drip once in seven days for only 14 minutes. In couple of minutes plants are able to absorb the required water. Drip irrigation and organic fertilizer are ideal combination for best farming practice as it holds the water and fertilizer in the stem and does not pull it deep inside the roots.” Rain water is stored in the sump in the farm. “In this way water gets stored and also soil does not wash away. We also have a house here so we collect the rain water on the terrace,” he adds. Mr. Choudhary is keen on expanding his organic pomegranate cultivation from 250 plants to 2000 plants. He adds, “I also plan to grow apple ber and date palm sapling in coming months. In addition I want to plant mukul comifora medicinal plant (called gugul in hindi). It is used for treating 250 kinds of diseases. I selected this medicinal plant again for the same reason that it grows well without water. It is best to flow with nature as nature has all solutions.” Contact details- Mr. Tarnjan Choudhary S/o Shri Kishtura Ram Choudhary, House Behind “Kisaan Girls Hostel”, Baldev Nagar, Barmer District, Rajasthan Mobile: 09413492561, 08003850755 Email: tarnjan@gmail.com Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Tarnjan Choudhary – medicinal plants in Rajasthan Related – articles, consultants, downloads Natural Remedies – Medicinal plants Mr. Ashok Kammath – Contract Cultivation of Medicinal Plants Contract Farming of Medicinal Plants Hardik Bhatt talks on medicinal and horticulture crops cultivation You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
