Go to the shop Sai Raghav Farms – Goat farming Home Sai Raghav Farms – Goat farming Stall-fed goat farm having pure talacherry and boer talacherry cross breeds goats Sai Raghav Farms is a goat farm located in Dodaballapur, Bangalore. Mr. Balasubramanian established the farm four years ago with a passion for agriculture. The farm is a stall-fed goat farm with about 100 goats. These include pure talacherry and boer talacherry cross breeds. The goats in the farm are primarily fed silage. Green fodder like agase, hebbevu and drumstick leaves are also given. Maize silage is given in the morning up to 3 kgs per goat which weigh 30 kgs. Green fodder in the afternoon and dry fodder like ragi straw and horse gram are given in the night. “We also give concentrated feed and mineral mixture for overall growth of the animals,” shares Mr. Mr. Balasubramanian. The goats are vaccinated for foot and mouth diseases, apart from being de-wormed. FMD Vaccination plays a major role in goat farming especially in stall-fed. Though open to all, most of the farm’s customers are beginners in goat farming, looking for high quality animals. Since these goats are considered as capital investment, the farmers tend to prefer quality over price. Mr. Balasubramaniam has never had issues with sale of his goats. With easy access to internet, he has been successful in attracting various customers. “Thanks to www.agriculture information.com, I get good customers. I sell live goats @ 350 Rs a kg which is higher than the normal market but that is because of the quality and almost zero mortality rate,” he further adds. No compromise on quality and selling price is the mantra that he follows. Mr. Balasubramanian is of the opinion that when one starts a goat farm, he should do it in a land of his own or a leased one. Patience, he says, is the most important virtue while operating a farm. “I suggest, start with small numbers like 25. Select the breed as per the market around the farm and be open to experimenting with breeds,” he adds. He does not encourage buying fodder from outside for farm animals. Proper vaccination and feeding pattern, monitoring food and water intake and providing mother’s milk to kids are the other important aspects of running a goat farm. In the days to come, Mr. Balasubramanian wishes to increase the number of breeds in his farm. He also hopes to try hydroponics for fodder growing when the number of animals in his farm reaches 500. Mr. Balasubramanian is a commerce graduate with diploma in materials management. He works in the finance department of a private company.
