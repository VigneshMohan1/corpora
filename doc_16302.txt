To accelerate the diffusion of agricultural technology to the farmers and develop models of cropping systems research in association with the ICAR, National Agricultural Technology Project with World Bank assistance has already started functioning. Lack of adequate manpower and equipment, the declining utility & effectiveness of Training and Visit (T & V) System and lack of professionalism have, however, affected extension services in the country. The 9th Five Year Plan had programmes for quality improvement and skill upgradation of extension personnel so that they could meet emerging challenges due to globalisation and commercialisation of agriculture. However, need was felt for supplementing the efforts of Government extension system to accelerate the process of technology transfer in agriculture. Apart from extension support, the farmers are also in need of supplementary sources of input supply and services for which, by and large, they presently depend upon public sector ageSncies and are getting less than satisfactory services. Since Independence strong academic centres have been built up for imparting education in 11 disciplines related to agriculture at under-graduate level viz. Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Horticulture, Sericulture, Forestry, Fisheries, Dairy Technology, Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural Marketing, Food Technology and Home Science. Annually around 10,000 students are admitted at U.G. level in State Agriculture Universities (SAU) alone. It is estimated that the turn-out of agricultural graduates is around 17,000 per annum if agricultural colleges in general universities and other educational institutions are also taken into account.  Still, only about 7000 to 8000 such graduates can be absorbed in employment avenues presently available in the Agriculture related jobs in both public / private sectors. There is a large reservoir of graduates in new and emerging areas in agricultural sector which awaits to be tapped for providing support services to farmers through Agri - Clinics and or Agri-Business Centres, supplementing the efforts of Government and public sector agencies, and filling critical gaps therein. It was felt that, around 10,000 fresh graduates, besides other graduates, who are already working, might prefer to make it their profession to provide paid services to the farmers, if opportunities are available for providing technical services support in agriculture related ventures. Thus, a need was felt for designing a programme for promoting such ventures as agri-clinics & agribusiness centres which could gainfully utilise the services and skills of agricultural graduates for supporting agriculture and allied activities, to complement Governmental efforts & to bring up the SPS standards of Indian agriculture. It was felt that, such deployment of trained and educated professionals would supplement and enhance the quality of the government development efforts. The Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, in association with NABARD has launched a unique programme to take better methods of farming to each and every farmer across the country. The Government is now also providing start-up training to graduates in Agriculture, or any subject allied to Agriculture like Horticulture, Sericulture, Veterinary Sciences, Forestry, Dairy, Poultry Farming, and Fisheries, etc. Those completing the training can apply for special start-up loans for venture. OBJECTIVES To supplement the efforts of Government extension system.  To make available the supplementary sources of input supply and services to needy farmers  To provide gainful employment to agriculture graduates in new emerging areas in agricultural sector CONCEPT / DEFINITION Agriclinics are envisaged to provide expert services and advice to farmers on cropping practices, technology dissemination, crop protection from pests and diseases, market trends and prices of various crops in the market and also clinical services for animal health etc. which would enhance productivity of crops/animals. Agribusiness Centres would provide paid services for enhancement of agriculture production and income of farmers. Centres would need to advice farmers on crop selection, best farm practices, post-harvest value-added options, key agricultural information (including perhaps even Internet-based weather forecast), price trends, market news, risk mitigation and crop insurance, credit and input access, as well as critical sanitary and phyto-sanitary considerations, which the farmers have to keep in mind.
