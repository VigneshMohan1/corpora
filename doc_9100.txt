I had done the planting after consulting him. But he gave me wrong information that it can grow in madhya pradesh area where as it grows only in very cold areas like uttarakhand. Be careful while dealing with these people. i still have all the bills and emails as proof.

We never give our farmers wrong information. We are qualified and experienced consulting company and not any traditional seed supplier/ trader. You are absolutely wrong here that Akarkara is cold region crop. It is cold season crop not cold region crop. Yes, it is winter crop of northern Indian plains (not Uttarakhand hills) but it is still cultivated majority of Indian states including M.P. We are ready to accept any challenge for an open debate on any public portal to prove us. The most important fact is majority of Akarkara farmers are in Uttar Pradesh and not in Uttarakhand. Even you can rarely find Akarkara growers in Uttarakhand and whatever farmers are there they are in Uttarakhand plains and not on hills. I can give you reference of those farmers who did trial of Akarkara in different plots of same location and in one, they get failure and in another they succeed at the same time. Can you tell me how is it with same package of recommendations? It is possible whe nyou are not able to provide the crop with recommended set of conditions. Actually, majority of newly entering people in farming community do not focus on planning. They do not want to invest on planning, to invite qualified experts and consultants for site visits. When they indulge themselves in hidden trials and get failure, tell us responsible for everything. It's not fair. Please try to accept your failure. Under the same thread, we have many growers who have successfully cultivated this crop during past years under our guidance. I personally invite all those growers and forum members who are associated with us, please come and add your opinion about our services, knowledge and experience. I invite you to visit with us the farmlands of our Akarkara farmers at various locations and remove your immature doubts. Finally, I suggest this forum member to realize the mistake you did, what were the possible shortcomings, discuss with us and do one more trial on small level instead of drawing false conclusions and provoking others. This is not a gentleman job. That's all for now. With best regards Reply With Quote December 5th, 2014 #26 puneetsingh30 Join Date Jun 2009 Posts 18 I am cultivating Akarkara from last 3 years with guidance of Dr Khan of Pioneeragri. Each year I got excellent results. Although in first year I got minimum yield approx 400 kgs / acre because I was new at that time. In 2nd year, I got 550 kgs per acre and third year 675 kgs from one acre area. this crop is very very sensitive to moisture so please focus only on water management for good germination. Dr Khan is very experienced and knowledgeable scientist and I got lot of benefits because of him.
