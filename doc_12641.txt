It must be noted that this variety is based on a certain tea plant, namely Camellia sinensis var. assamica. Assam tea can be used either alone or in various blends, and it is above all recommended for breakfast. Also, mixing it with milk is never a bad idea. More than that, Assam tea is a perfect choice for making iced tea. Some of the characteristics that make the Assam tea stand apart include the strong body, the briskness and the lively color. All these particularities are a result of the fact that Assam tea is manufactured from a specific tea plant.
