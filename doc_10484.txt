He established In Orbit Tours in 1978 to facilitate tours to trade exhibitions around the globe in order to assist knowledge exchange in various fields. The company organises tours in the fields of plastics, textiles, chemicals, steel, packaging, engineering, electronics and agriculture and its branches. The company arranges and provides travel packages to fairs and exhibitions. The company organises about 3-4 agriculture related tours annually. The segments included under agriculture and its branches include irrigation, horticulture, dairy, animal husbandry, poultry and seeds. At present the exhibitions which the company promotes are Agritech Israel Expo (held in Israel every 3 years), World Dairy Expo and Summit China (held every year), China Agrochemicals Expo, China Irrigation Expo, China Fertilizers Expo, Pig and Poultry Expo Germany, VIV Asia- Thailand for Poultry and Animal husbandry. The company arranges tours in such a way as to match each segment of agriculture to enable a delegate to visit and see demonstrations only about his own choice subjects. “We circulate the exhibit profile of the trade fairs and it is to their advantage to select the trade or tour of their choice,” shares Mr. Sahgal. The cost of travel packages ranges from Rs. 50,000/- to Rs 1.75 lacs with days ranging from 4-10 days. “The visitors certainly like to get value for their time and money. Hence the challenge is to show them something more than what they see and do,” he shares, “There is a high level of interest among all segments of agriculture to travel to foreign countries, especially to visit agriculture exhibitions and to visit farms, institutions for practical knowledge.” The most recent of such tours include a 15 member delegation from India to China International Fruit and Vegetable Import and Export Trade fair 2014 held from Nov 15-22. “This specialized fresh fruit international show opened its doors for fresh fruit suppliers to tap the vast Chinese market,” he shares. The other is VIV Asia 2015 which exhibited animal production and processing of meat, eggs, fish and milk which was conducted from 11-13 March 2015. He says, “No other trade show in Asia offers such a broad pallet of opportunities.” The company is now scheduled for Agritech Israel, one of the world’s most important exhibitions in the field of agriculture technologies, to be held from April 28-30 2015 at Israel Trade Fairs and Convention Centre in Tel Aviv. The target customers include agriculture and horticulture related cooperative societies, associations, farmers, dairymen, veterinary experts, seeds companies, agriculture machinery and equipment companies, agriculture, consultants, etc. To reach these customers the company mails the tour details in hardcopy and email, advertise in agriculture media, contact agri-associations and request them to circulate the information. They also participate in agriculture related exhibitions held in various parts of the country. Advising Indian farmers who want to exhibit their farm produce in International Fairs Mr. Sahgal suggests, “They should participate in the events abroad organised by Ministry of Agriculture or APEDA or Horticulture Board and such organisations which have Govt. of India’s Subsidy especially by Export Promotion Councils.” “Our future plans are to organise more of agriculture study tours with focus on agri-segments like fruits, vegetables, dry fruits, agro products,” shares Mr. Sahgal. “We will be interested to invite organisations, portals, professionals to jointly carry out this mission to educate Indian farmers, agriculturists, manufacturers of farming equipment and implements manufacturers, agriculture scientists and Agri Consultants to get better exposure.” Contact details- In Orbit Tours Pvt.
