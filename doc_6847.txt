They also believed that micro level initiatives at grassroots levels are must to bring about stable livelihood creations to remove mass poverty in our villages. SAMPARK started to work with farmers for providing them with appropriate solutions to increase the productivity with limited resources. With the ideal well grounded in practice, SAMPARK aims to spread out and expand its outreach to disseminate ‘developmental technologies’ and mobilize communities to build upon their skills, initiatives and resources.
