Soon will start selling in India too Passim Texin was established in Mumbai to supply fresh vegetables at reasonable costs everywhere. The founders are Mrs. Sreevidya Sharma and Mr. Devraj Sharma. The company currently supplies vegetables to Gulf nations and will soon supply within India too. The operations of the company aim to shorten the link between growers and the consumers. The company deals with all conventional vegetables like cabbage, potato, onion and tomato. All products from Passim are exported to Gulf countries through exporters. Though the company currently trades its vegetables, it soon plans to start a farm of their own. “We have a few dedicated suppliers who source our requirements directly from farmers or contract farmers. We do not have one single source as it’s a seasonal business and same vegetables are grown at different regions according to climatic conditions,” shares Mr. Sharma. For storage of vegetables and perishable items, Passim currently uses cold storage. Special packing is done for products as specified by customers in the order. While buying produce from farmers, the company has to follow quality standards, different from standards in India, since export rules require it to comply with the customers’ demand. “We are open to farmers supplying us always,” says Mr. Sharma on farmer associations with Passim. The farmers need to contact the company before the sowing season. It will then monitor their regular activities. Once aware of their growing practices, certain changes as per requirements are recommended. If these are acceptable, a trial run is done. If mutually suitable, the farmers can then become Passim’s regular suppliers. Speaking of price exploitation by farmers Mr. Sharma says, “We have faced a lot of problems in this regard. The local middlemen and the mandi do not take lightly to farmers supplying us directly.” To avoid farmer exploitation by middlemen, Mr. Sharma advocates working out a price mechanism where flexibility is given to the farmers as per their needs. Thus, a fair deal can be ensured through the farmer’s inputs. Mr. Sharma’s experience in the field, he says, has given him many varied experiences. He shares one such experience where he was fooled by a conman on the pretext of being a farmer, “I was on a procurement trip in Yellapur, near Hubli. Out of the blue, a farmer approached me with a few samples of his crop and offered me his entire cultivated stock for a fair price. I agreed to pick up the entire stock the next day. When I reached the godown I found it deserted only to be told that the farmer was actually a conman who would do this with newcomers. If they parted with any advance that was the last they would see of him. Luckily I had just given him Rs. 51.” In the future, Passim Texin aims to extend its services from exporters to end consumers locally. It may also start retail farming in India from November. Mr. Sharma is a B.Com graduate from Mumbai University.
