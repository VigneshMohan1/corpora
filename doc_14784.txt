Figure  Indian Ocean Dipole mode Index (DMI). The DMI is defined as the difference between the SST anomalies (ºC) of Western (10ºS-10ºN & 50ºE-70ºE) and Eastern (10ºS-0ºN & 90ºE-110ºE) Equatorial Indian Ocean regions (WEST-EAST). SST and SST anomalies over different regions of IOD for the last 12 months. Figure  Depth-longitude section of the (10ºS-0ºN) region averaged temperature (ºC) for the latest month for the Indian Ocean longitudes Figure  Depth-longitude section of the (10ºS-0ºN) region averaged temperature (ºC) anomalies for the latest month for the Indian Ocean longitudes.
