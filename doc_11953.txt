We strategically emphasise on promoting quality healthcare, inclusive education, gender equitable and sustainable livelihood opportunities and disaster relief and preparedness. Our efforts are focused to fight against underlying causes of poverty, building secure and resilient communities and ensuring a life of dignity for all women and girls from the most marginalised and vulnerable communities, especially among Dalits and Adivasis. As we move ahead our key programming approaches will include social analysis and action, gender transformative value chain approaches, leadership and life skills strengthening, building capacities and leadership roles at multiple levels, advocacy on national and international platforms and facilitating links and dialogues between public, private and civil society.   CARE Initiatives CARE works with more than 200 districts, in a total of 13 states and union terriotories across India Engage educate empower Assurance of a secure life Livelihood Initiative Tsunami Power to Empower Cyclone Hudhud Horlicks Ahaar Abhiyan GiveAssure Help Shanti JK Flood crisis Join my village VIEW ALL Latest Publications Pages from booklet 1 pages from booklet hindi-7-2.pdf READ MORE Case Studies Education Health Livelihood Emergency Blog Resources © 2014 CARE India.
