We hope that you will use these forums to share ideas, resources, collaborate and connect with fellow educators and business partners. Based on member feedback, we have upgraded our online community to improve the user experience. The NAF Community now features searchable forums where you can connect and share resources with your peers and learn from each other. These forums will make it easier to find the answers to your most burning questions. Dedicated discussion groups with forums viewable only to group members can be created by site administrators. If you believe you have a need for a group separate from the forums, contact us . Where have all the resources from the Collaboration Network gone? Our rich library of resources can now be found on naf.org ! For teacher & administrator resources, click here . For business partner resources, click here . We hope you find this new community useful and look forward to spreading knowledge more easily across the NAF network! Login to post a new topic or comment.
