We would be left with only concrete jungles and deserts. Plants, trees, shrubs and flowers provide greenery which is a feast to the eyes . Plants are the most versatile organic material on earth. Naturally plants decompose as they die and fertilize the soil to keep the soil rich in nutrients. Without plants soil erosion occurs by weathering, and hence the ability to grow food for humans will be at stake. Plants provide humans with necessary food like vegetables and fruits. They also provide food for most of the animals and many fishes that we eat. They also provide many of the materials we use today such as wood for shelter, medicines, sugar, starches, oils, waxes, fibers, paper, rubber, gums, and resins. Apart from the direct benefits from the plants, they provide some important indirect benefits to the living things of the world. Above all plants provide oxygen because of which we are all here in this beautiful World of plants.  1) OPERATIONAL MANUAL Of DO IT YOURSELF KIT 2) INPUT DETAILS OF DO IT YOURSELF KIT 3) DO IT YOURSELF KIT - APPLY NOW Preparation of medium Fruit set and harvest Visitor Counter: 843444 Since: 15th October 2012 Accessibility Options Terms & Conditions Disclaimer Accessibility Statement Sitemap Hyperlinking Policy FAQs Feedback Privacy Policy Copyright Policy Copyright © Department of Horticulture and Plantation Crops.
