Together, NAF and corporate partners crafted the pioneering NAFTrack Certification, which will be used to signify students as NAF Certified. This rigorous and comprehensive assessment system evaluates students on academic proficiency, project execution, and internship performance.   NAFTrack Founding Partners AT&T   Juniper Networks Cisco    KPMG LLP EMC   Verizon HP   Xerox  JPMorgan Chase           NAFTrack Benefits Include: Pre-interview and resume support Guaranteed interviews in equally qualified applicant pools Potentially expedited advancement in the hiring process Priority hiring among equally qualified applicant pools Potential for higher starting salaries Applicant feedback and coaching post interview College internship opportunities Support to ensure more NAFTrack Certified Graduates attend the postsecondary institutions where they recruit   For more information on NAFTrack, contact us .     ShareThis For Business Partners Resources Work-Based Learning Center NAFTrack Copyright © 2012 National Academy Foundation.
