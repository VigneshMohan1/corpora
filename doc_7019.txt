Systems Operations Waste products are handled in systems consisting of production, treatment, storage, and utilization subsystems. In this program area, we give managers the tools to properly operate waste handling systems.  This area also includes the environmental impacts of waste handling, and regulations covering the safe operation of systems.  Waste Treatment  Treatment is the transformation of byproducts to make them easier to handle, less noxious, and better suited for other uses.  Some treatment technologies we are working on in Oklahoma include composting, vermicomposting, and anaerobic digestion.   Other Waste Management Web Resources at Oklahoma State Some other websites dealing with waste management include: Manure Utilization website in Plant and Soil Science.
