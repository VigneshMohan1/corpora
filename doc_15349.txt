Excessive rain at any stage is harmful to the crop. It can be grown in a wide variety of soils. A deep homogeneous fertile soil is desirable.

SeedsAndCultivation   Preparation of land and sowing Plough the land three to four times and form ridges and furrows. Dibble the seeds on the sides of the furrows. Use basalin at the rate of 2.5 l/ha before irrigating the field to control the weeds. Note: Treat the seeds with carbendazim 50 WP (2 g/kg) or Trichoderma viride talc preparation (4 g/kg) before sowing.

WaterManagement In the case of irrigated crop, irrigate the plants once in two weeks. Copious irrigation during flowering will ensure good pod setting and good fibre quality. Top... NutrientManagement   Apply FYM or compost @ 12.5 t/ha for rainfed crop and 25 t/ha for irrigated crop. Apply N:P2O5:K2O each @ 35 kg/ha as basal dressing. Topdress with 35 kg N per ha about 45 days after sowing Top... WeedManagement   Thin the crop when the plants are 15 to 20 cm high retaining two seedlings per hill. Retain only one seedling per hill in the case of hybrids. Timely weeding and hoeing will ensure good crop growth. Top... PestManagement Against sucking pests like jassids, aphids and thrips, spray methyl-O-demeton (500 ml/ha) or imidacloprid (100 ml/ha) on 20th day and 40th day. To control whitefly, use neem oil (3.0 l/ha) or phosalone (2.5-3.0 l/ha). For bollworm, spray monocrotophos or quinalphos or chlorpyrifos (2-3 l/ha), starting from 55th day of sowing at 15 days interval or more depending on the pest prevalence. Top... DiseaseManagement  For bacterial blight disease, use streptocycline (50 g/ha + copper oxychloride 1.5 kg/ha). For grey mildew, carbendazim @ 250 g / ha may be used. For Alternaria leaf spot, use copper oxychloride @ 1.5 kg/ha. Top... Harvesting  The bolls burst within 100-120 days after sowing and will be ready for harvest at this stage. Top...
