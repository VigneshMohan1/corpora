Untitled Document Spring . . . a time of renewal and regrowth Any forage grower knows that dormancy is not such a bad thing. It gives the plant time to rest, repair and rejuvenate. Out of dormancy each spring often comes a plant with new vigor and life. Such is also the case for Hay & Forage Grower magazine and the eHay Weekly digital newsletter; long-trusted information resources that are coming out of dormancy with a new publisher, the W.D. Hoard & Sons Company in Fort Atkinson, Wis. There will also be a new editor . . . you'll meet him soon. As a current eHay subscriber, watch your email inbox for the launch of Hay & Forage Grower 's eHay Weekly on Tuesday, June 9th . We know this will be the beginning of a long stand life and high-yielding relationship with you.
