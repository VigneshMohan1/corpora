While it has achieved a significant reduction in extreme poverty, the region remains home to a majority of the world’s extremely poor. With $22.93 billion in approved financing in 2014 and 2,997 employees from 60 of its 67 members, ADB in partnership with member governments, independent specialists and other financial institutions is focused on delivering projects that create economic and development impact. Economists, sociologists, engineers, gender experts and environmental scientists are amongst the hundreds of professions at the bank working together to reduce poverty. Environmental sustainability is a core strategy of ADB’s work as it is the poor that are most severely affected.  Environmental damage and resource depletion are already impeding the region’s development and reducing the quality of life. ADB is active in creating the framework for the private sector to be involved in investing in new projects that underpin development and improve the lives of the 1.4 billion people in the region who live on less than $2 a day. Since 2000, the Asian Development Fund has transformed the region with the construction of thousands of schools, bridges, health clinics and roads, providing opportunities for people to lift themselves out of poverty. Asian Development Fund operations completed during 2011-2014 has helped ADB’s poorest member countries deliver results in many areas. It has: built or upgraded educational facilities for the benefit of over 17 million students, and trained over 1 million teachers with quality or competency standards. More than 28 million students were educated and trained under improved quality assurance systems; built or upgraded 25,000 km of roads which saw over 10 million vehicle-km of daily use on average in the first full year of operation; provided more than 1 million households with access to clean water by installing or rehabilitating 15,000 km of water supply pipes, and upgraded sanitation in 293,000 households. Almost 2 million hectares of land have been improved as a result of irrigation, drainage, and flood management initiatives; installed 230 megawatts of new generating capacity, and built or upgraded 11,300 kilometers (km) of transmission and distribution lines; and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by promoting more efficient and cleaner energy operations.
