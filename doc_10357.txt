Now I am in the process of getting the dairy farm fully functional which will happen within a short time, I am sure about its set up and success. Right now to manage both is tough but certainly through the time I will enjoy and do both the business with ease”.

Mr. Arun Kumar maintains. “we give around 300 grams of concentrate per cow with 1kg for maintenance.” He further adds, “it is difficult to decide on dairy animal feed but I have always worked on the nutrition required based on the milk production or the stage of the particular animal and give the required nutrition including protein, carbohydrates, energy, vitamin and minerals.” An animal needs 3 to 3.5 % of feed of its body weight. The above 3.5 % should be given in right ratio. Manpower 5 laborers, 1 supervisor, 1 milk supplier, 1 veterinarian, and 1 agriculture supervisor are working at Fourseasonz Dairy Farm. Dairy Technology “We use milking machine as it is not possible to milk 70 animals at one time. Secondly it is more hygienic to the animals and people consuming the milk,” informs Mr. Arun Kumar. He is MBA graduate with 3 years of practical experience working in his farm. His future plan is to first establish this dairy farm with normal production and proper nutrition then move on with other plans.
