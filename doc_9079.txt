The overall control on refinance of the loans extended by Banks vests with NABARD. The interest rates are fixed based on the risk perception both in regard to the crop as well as the borrower. Also, the overall risk relating to the growing of the produce, market price, etc. are considered by Banks before extending credit. The best way for a farmer to approach a Bank is through a SHG or cluster thus minimizing the credit risk both the lender and borrower. Banks would be most happy to extend loans to farmers in cluster or SHG basis. As an ex-banker, I do not agree with this opinion that ' a farmer is not treated properly' which I know generally exists amongst all those who approach the bank. The main reason for this perception is that the uneducated farmer feels very insecure when he approaches the banker largely due to his lack of knowledge of banking procedures. He therefore, feels intimidated by the atmosphere prevailing in the Bank. For this reason, high priority is required to be given to educating the farmers on the govt. policies and programs which he can fruitfully avail of. Agriculture is a very lucrative business if followed wisely. HPL Global Services Pvt Ltd Plot #1B, 2nd Floor, Babu Jegan Street, Kannan Bala Nagar, Arumbakkam Chennai 600106.

Government banks in some branches treat their customer as if the bank is customer of their own customer, and sometimes even worse. But that’s not the case everywhere. A coin always has two sides, while behavior of bank staff gets worse with less literate customer, similarly annoying questions increases with decreasing literacy of customer. Although, it is the job of the bank employees to help their customer, we should not forget these people are one of us, and react in similar fashion. While long day with annoying questions irritate them, doing job for months in such conditions change their behavior. We should not forget bank is just an organization made out of people, but I will suggest forcing bank employees from their higher officials to behave similarly with illiterate and literate customers could help a lot.

However the variation is very small. Banks do not negotiate or you cannot make any bargain with exception of very large industrial houses. Framers can be rest assured that ROI is generally normal and farmer has to approach only locally available bank and hence has no choice. But I would rather say he should concentrate on large production or higher yields. Economies of scale help a lot for success and profitability. This is definitely a wrong idea. To be acceptable you should demonstrate professionalism even if you are uneducated. I know of 7th standard passed farmers taking loans of 2 crores in very simple crop cultivation projects. If you ask businessmen they will say farmers are pampered with easy loans, write off, more subsidies etc., I would rather say concentrate on your work, present the proposal smartly and show proven record. More than anything build relationship and be humble. Anybody will melt for this mantra. A. S.

There should be a clear-cut and commodity based uniform policy for each and every enterprise and the growers should be known to it for their access to such loans.

Govt started the KCC ( Kisan Credit Card ), it was very good scheme and linked with the land mortgage. The farmer get loan at very low interest, it is around 6 %, some state govt give subsidy of 1 % or 2%. farmer also get some timely repayment bonus. the timely repayment also increase the credit limit of farmer. IF the repayment schedule of farmer is good then he will not face any problem in loan.

If he has successfully completed his last assignments then he must be given more loan.
