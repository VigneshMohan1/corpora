There are three categories available for judging when the awards close on 15 August 2015. The first Award is for existing video production partners of Access Agriculture, who have been trained by the organisation in producing agricultural video programmes in local languages.  The next Award is for Media Houses who have been able to use the programmes either as videos, sound clips for radio or as contributions in print. The final Award is based on outreach of the videos through DVD distribution or organising of video shows and collecting feedback. The prizes will include trophies, still cameras and a smart projector which can show all of the Access Agriculture videos “offline”.  Judging will take place in September and the winners will be announced in October.  The entry forms are available on the website here .
