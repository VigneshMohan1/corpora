A moratorium was placed on the tax credit during the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2012. Litter must originate from Oklahoma Nutrient Limited Watersheds and be applied outside of those watersheds. If the tax credit exceeds an individual’s income tax due, the unused credit may be carried over for up to 5 years. This program is funded at $375,000 annually. The Oklahoma Tax Commission has included the Poultry Litter Tax Credit on form #511CR, “Schedule for Other Credits” for filing with the state income tax return. Once the 2012 form is available from the Tax Commission, a link will be posted at:   http://www.ok-littermarket.org/incentives.asp . To see the Oklahoma Statutes concerning tax credits for purchase and transportation of poultry litter please visit this site: http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=443894 .

Mesonet launches Cattle Comfort Advisor tool September 2012 – Sitting on the couch, enjoying the air conditioning and sipping on a cold drink definitely hits the spot for many Oklahomans who have been battling the 100 F plus temperatures outside. However, cattle don’t enjoy those same luxuries. “We all know that the current heat we are experiencing has been tough on people and animals,” said Al Sutherland, Oklahoma State University Cooperative Extension assistant specialist. “At the Oklahoma Mesonet, we are in the final stages of bringing a new Cattle Comfort Advisor online.” Reading a thermometer will tell us it is hot outside, but it will not give us the true story of what it feels like to cattle. The Cattle Comfort Advisor aims to do just that. Click here to read more about this new Mesonet feature . Click here to read more about using the Cattle Comfort Advisor .
