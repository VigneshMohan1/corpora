Weill, Chairman Emeritus of Citigroup Inc., as a partnership between business leaders and educators. Weill’s vision was to address the lack of opportunity for New York City public high school students. He designed a program that brought businesses and educators together to put students on a career path leading to Wall Street. The New York City Board of Education accepted his program and, with a grant from the American Express Foundation, opened the first Academy of Finance (AOF) in a Brooklyn public high school in 1982.   Since then, Weill, NAF staff, and corporate and civic partners collaborated to add career themes, including Academies of Hospitality & Tourism, Academies of Information Technology, Academies of Engineering, and Academies of Health Sciences.   The National Academy Foundation was developed early on to support and unite the growing network of academies across the country. NAF academies now total 667, serve over 80,000 students, and operate in 38 states, including the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
