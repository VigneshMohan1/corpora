FUNCTION The system controls the supply of water to the plants by a network of tubes with water under pressure. b. EQUIPMENTS / COMPONENTS The Head unit consists of a pump or over head tank. Mainline 50 mm, 63 mm and 75 mm HDPE or PVC pipes are used Submain 45 mm, 50 mm HDPE pipes are used. Laterals 12 mm and 16 mm LLDPE pipes are used. Drippers - pressure compensating type 2 lph, 4 lph, 8 lph are more suitable Filter unit : Sand filter for coarse particle detention. Mesh filter (120 micron) for fine particle detention. Fertiliser unit: A fertiliser tank with ventury setup is used for applying liquid or dissolved fertilisers. Pressure gauges 0.5 to 2.5 Ksc and gate valve depending on pipe size are also essential for the system to control and monitor the flow.      Fertilizer Tank – cost Rs 3500                                                         Ventury Rs 1250  Fertilizer pump Rs. 12,000 c. SALIENT FEATURES 50 to 65% water saving compared to control method. Crop attains early maturity. Crop quality and yield increased. Requires least land levelling. Poor quality water can be used. Advantages of drip irrigation system (after sailent features) High quality and increased fruit size Suitable for all types of soil Easy method of fertigation and chemigation Saving in labour and field preparation cost Disadvantage of drip irrigation system High initial investment Clogging of emitters Possible damage of system components due to animals, etc., Investment cost mostly differs based on spacing of the crops Generally, the reasons for clogging are solid particles (sand, rust), soft dirt (organic matter, algae, micro organism, salt), sediments (salt in the fertilizers). Filtration is the main key factor to the success or failure of the system. The main of filtration is to stop dirt particles which damage any components of the system. To remove salt encrustation, 30 per cent commercial hydrochloric acid can been used at the rate of one liter per one m3 area. (One part HCl mixed with 5 parts of water) To remove algae and fungal clogging 5 to 500 ppm sodium hydrochloride (10 per cent chlorine) can be used. Maintenance of drip system Back washing and sand filters has to be cleaned Frequent cleaning of emitters and drippers Flushing at every irrigation Cleaning of sub main and main pipes Cleaning of PVC pipes and laterals and acid or chlorine may be used to remove clogging.
