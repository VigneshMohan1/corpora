The remaining provisions are going to be notified shortly. Hence , the food safety personnel across the Country need to equip and enrich themselves about the shift in the shortest possible time, failing which the food safety works would suffer serious setbacks and would nullify the positive changes that are purported to be brought in by the new Act(FSSA). The existing food regulatory staffs is focused on sampling and prosecution and may not be equipped to carry out the much wider range of responsibilities envisaged under the new act. Similarly the food Safety regulators including State Food Safety Commissioners , Designated officers, Adjudicating officers and Food Safety Officers has to acquire requisite dedicated national level Capacity building programme for various categories of Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954 and involved in granting licenses to various categories of Food Business Operators. In this backdrop, FSSAI has devised interim induction programmes modules to be taken up as an initial exercise to make existing food safety regulators well acquainted with wide spectrum of regulatory provisions and new concepts developed in various regulatory mechanisms under the FSS Act, 2006. These are programmes for Training of Trainers (ToT) and it is advisable that each State/UT nominates appropriate officers for these programmes. The Officials nominated need to have aptitude and flair for training others and should be made available subsequently for Training programmes within the State (and elsewhere, in case FSSAI finds them to be exceptionally suited). This will enable the concerned States to cope with the changed mandate of the FSS Act, 2006 and would make the migration smother for various stakeholders in the concerned States. All the States have been requested to nominate appropriate officers for the ToT programmes and inform the details of the same to Sh. R.Vijay, Director, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, FDA Bhawan, Kotla Road, New Delhi-110002.
