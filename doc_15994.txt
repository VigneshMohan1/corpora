Home - ACMF Home Organisation Our Efforts Work by ACMF Contact Us Agriculture Consultancy Management Foundation (ACMF)       Set up in 2006 as a not-for-profit trust to demonstrate productivity improvements in agriculture, ACMF aims at  a 10 per cent growth for agriculture. It is not just desirable, but feasible. ACMF believes in a high double digit growth for the agriculture sector. There are several favourable factors: Large arable land. Agro climatic conditions and endowment  that favour farming round the year. Availability of large numbers of  farm hands. Present low levels of average productivity that  lend for quantum growth.
