Scientists located at the USDA-ARS Plant Science and Water Conservation Research Laboratory conduct genetic investigations critical to the program. Program direction is provided by the OSU Wheat Genetics Chair, currently occupied by Brett F. Carver.   The original occupant of the Chair was Edward L. Smith, from 1989 to 1997.   This web site is intended for the use of all shareholders in the Oklahoma wheat continuum, from seed producer to end-user, from ag consultant to media representative.
