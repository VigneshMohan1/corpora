Successfully farming and selling Jeevanti Shivsagar Herbal Farm deals with medicinal herbs, especially with threatened species. The company was established in 2004 by founders, Mr. Ramesh Chandra L. Joshi and Mr. Bhargav R. Joshi. Located at Bhuj, Gujarat. The company is driven by a mission to conserve some of the threatened medicinal herbs and to propagate them on commercial base and make them available in bulk with standard quality. Herbs are grown in the company’s own farm. Leptadenia Reticulata with the trade name Jeevanti, a perennial herb, is the main product of the company. The annual yield of the herb is 35 mt. and they hope to increase this yield to 50 mt. It takes one year to develop a commercial yield of Jeevanti. Though available on buy-back system, Shivsagar advocates farmers to grow the herb on their own to avoid farmer exploitation. Pharmaceutical companies in ayurveda and veterinaries are the main customers of the company. “Owing to our unbeaten standard quality of well managed dried herb, our esteemed customers are the real promoters of our market,” shares Mr. Ramesh. Awareness is created through personal approach and the web. Precise integrated farming, scientific post-harvest management as per GAP Norms and Qualitative consistent supply are the special features the company’s products that set them apart from the rest in the industry. The company encourages association with farmers. However they have been facing difficulties with farmers’ associations. They hope to overcome this issue after achieving milestone success. Speaking of other challenges, Mr. Ramesh shares, “inadequate knowledge, carelessness and unwillingness to adjust and adopt new techniques of farming are the main culprits and we push them back.” Shivsagar Herbal Farm wishes to create a common platform for farmers engaged in medicinal herb farming to sell their products by forming farmers’ cooperative society. Such societies will enable farmers to get right benefits for their hard work. Mr. Ramesh Chandra Joshi holds an M.Sc. in Experimental Biology and has been in the field since 1971.
