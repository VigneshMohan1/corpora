NMPB was established in the year 2000 by Government of India and is the apex organization to coordinate all matters related to medicinal plants. At present the organization has implemented two schemes under the 12th plan. “One is the central sector scheme for conservation, development and sustainable management of medicinal plants, and the other is centrally sponsored scheme of national mission on medicinal plants,” says Ms. Negi, “One of the schemes has been subsumed under the National Ayush Mission (NAM).” Under NAM there is a component of nurseries to make planting material available to the farmers. There are also facilitation centers in various states to address knowledge needs of the farmers. “Under cultivation scheme, subsidy is provided at 30 %, 50% and 75 % of the cost,” informs Ms Negi. The organization has published agro techniques of 83 species available for reference for farmers. ‘A financial support of Rs 10 lacs’ is also provided per JFMC/BMC for setting up value addition and primary processing facilities. “This is to ensure quality of the produce,” adds Ms Negi, “thereby augmenting the incomes of the local people.” Reaching out to the farmers, Ms Negi mentions the required farming factors for medicinal plants; Organic condition of farming, good quality planting material, good agricultural practices, proper harvest, drying and storage. It is better to enter into a buy-back arrangement with an industry so that the farmer grows what is required by industry rather than “growing something and then looking for buyers.” Pippali, Sarpagandha, Mulethi, Guggal, Ashwagandha, and Tulsi are expected to be in demand in the coming years. Adding to the list further are senna, giloe, satavari isabgol, pacholi, lemongrass, agar etc. Speaking of cultivation from a farmer’s point of view, Ms Negi opines, “Instead of reviving we should be focusing on other species which have demand, thus diversifying the basket of species that farmers have to offer.” Issue of quality and higher active ingredient concentration in the medicinal plants rather than species alone would help more in being successful in medicinal plant business. For the nation to gain from global demand of botanicals Ms Negi believes more of finished products and value added products like extract should be exported instead of exporting only the raw materials. Highlighting the conservative works, she says that NMPB has been able to revive and conserve species like Gloriosa superba, andriographis paniculata, Shwertia chiraita, commiphora wightii, ashoka etc. from extinction. The future plans of the organization include setting up of raw drug repositories retail outlets at the village, districts and state levels and setting up of herbal gardens. It also endeavors to expand cultivation scheme, set up processing facilities, raise awareness level, increase R&D, make available quality planting material and further conserve species in their native habitat. Ms. Meenakshi Negi is an IFS and has a Master’s degree in Forestry and M.Phil in Quality of Botanicals.
