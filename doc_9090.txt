We have united 51 goat farmers and we have formed a union. Now the goats are being sold in bulk quantity due to group farming. Presently subsidies from NABARD have been stopped since the last 3 years, and so people should apply now for subsidies and have to start their own. Initially there will be some hurdles but we have to overcome them. We have started our goat farming with just 2 goats and now we are selling more than 4000 goats per year.

Yes, it’s true that if farmers work together in group, they will be secured and also profitable. But here in India the main issue is LACK OF TRUST when we work in group, we have the trust so we have formed groups to work, but when it comes to sharing a profit that time problems occur. But yes, if every farmer follows a standard process (which is transparent) slowly they will get adapted to it, and the end result will be surely appreciated.

Organic Group farming is the future. But some individual Professionals are also coming to the world of Organic farming and adopting the latest technologies. Group farming is coming up very well and the Govt. is also promoting it to a great extent. The Government exchequer has good allotment for the Agri- sector as Agriculture is the backbone of our Economy. So all the available resources and subsidies from Govt. has to be utilised fully and latest technologies has to be adopted for better productivity.

But in the present circumstances due to the changes labor situation and also due to the fact that it is imperative for one to labor in the field has changed the equation totally. Group farming will ensure pooling of resources and is a better survival technique. But total organic cultivation is one which is yet to prove itself. Definitely the farmers should unite to get the synergy on various inputs and follow the latest practices and technologies. Government subsidies need to be looked at from different angles. Of course, totally depending on subsidies is a no-no. But subsidizing farmers to adopt new cultivation techniques and practices may be a base for building his confidence. But these should be withdrawn on a phased manner. Once the farmer is confident on the system he then should be on his own. Toyo Biotech TOYO Adoor House, Thevally P.O.

Farmers must implement the latest technologies. They need a group discussion about the farming, selling, and price fixing, arrangement, cold storage controlled harvesting etc., will help our farmers. Gradually we can convert to organic cultivation. And thoughts of farmers also need to change. They should know that they are the base of the human beings. If they are not producing food grains how can these white collared people eat? Can they eat computers and new technologies?

Yes, in India it’s not yet adopted fully but we can learn things how we can reduce more risks by group farming rather than individual. We have to build trust on each other and should make transparent policies. I believe group farming reduces more losses and people can be more updated time to time. Govt. policies are available to help farmers but they cannot depends on them. They have their own courage to prove themselves by unite and updated about new technologies of smart farming.
