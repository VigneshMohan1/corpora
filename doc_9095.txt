There are agriculture fairs also for the farmers who are not literate and even the newspapers with agriculture edition covering technologies also helps. So it’s necessary to adopt new technologies time to time through any of these mode. Everyone needs to aware of all those modes and Govt. should provide more learning classes for farmer’s economic growth.

V Thomas, CEO Vanilla India Producer Company Ltd says- I cannot agree with the statement. Farmers who are educated depend on internet. To introduce new technologies the Agriculture Department; take initiative to transfer the technologies to the farmers through the Krishi Bhavans and also the government should take steps to instruct the field staff of the agriculture department to visit frequently the farmers in their land where they are farming and support them with valid advices for high tech farming.

However, since majority of Indian farmers are Small and Marginal they will not afford internet connectivity. Government should take initiatives to provide internet facilities at Panchayats and other village level government establishments.

So this model will be fail. There should be a dedicated education series of all type of programs. Agriculture experts should deliver lectures at village level only. Two way communication will bring the right results.
