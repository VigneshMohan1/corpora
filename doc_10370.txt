Your shopping bag is empty. Go to the shop Gokhale Agro Products Home Gokhale Agro Products Gokhale Agro Products is a farming consultancy service geared towards the improvement of crop yield. The company specializes in the yield improvement of citrus fruits, pomegranates and mangoes. An exception in the company’s area of specialty is their knowledge on improving the yield of cotton crop. Mr. K.G. Gokhal, a chemistry graduate with experience in both pharmaceuticals and agriculture, is the company’s technical consultant. Advice Plant diseases are often responsible for low crop growth and survival. Mr. Gokhal shared that the number one way to avoid plant disease is to put a special emphasis on the health of both soil and plants through organic forms of silica, which help strengthen a plant’s natural immunity. Mr. Gokhal also warned against fungal attacks that cause mango inflorescence. Opinions With plant growth promoters flooding the market, Mr. Gokhal said, “Merits of such products depend upon individual product composition, time of use, and proper dosage.” He recommended non-invasive, outside support for the plants in order to gain an advantage in the market. Additionally, he encouraged farmers to gain knowledge on more medicinal crops with high therapeutic and prophylactic values. Future Plans Gokhale Agro Products has enjoyed reasonable success, having been able to save many small pomegranate orchards. However, the company still yearns to help farmers find solutions for crop afflictions. Mr. Gokhal shared that they hope to find the remedy for the devastating Citrus Canker disease and help small cotton farmers to increase their per acre yield in the next five years.
