To increase production and productivity and farm income. To increase productivity of major crops. Production and productivity figures may not be available by April-May, and may not be considered for evaluation. Further productivity is dependent on some factors beyond human control like weather conditions, wild animals problem. Growth rate in agriculture and allied sector is targetted as 4% and agriculture will contribute 2%.  2.To disseminate latest production technology, efficient agriculture input management and their quality control. Demonstrations, trainings, farm information dissemination, women in agriculture. Emphasis will be on increase in production and thereby income of farmers. During the year 2350 number demonstrations will be layed, 38500 training &exposure days will be generated, and 40000 literature pamphlets will be distributed.  Achievement of targets shall depend upon issue of AA/ES and fund release by government of india/state to the implementing agency /department by 30th of April.   Timely supply of inputs Seed, fertiliser and pesticide  requirement depends upon weather conditions and is beyond human control.  Thus it may vary. page : 11 of 17   Seed treatment For the management of seed borne diseases, seed treatment is very important. The department will organise awareness camps during the crop season and will provide seed treatment chemicals to farmers. 3. Diversification for higher farm income and efficient marketing. Increase in area under vegetables. To encourage the farmers for cultivation of vegetable crops in potential areas, identification of potential clusters will be done. The capacity building and skill up-gradation of the farmers will be done at KVK’s. 40 clusters shall be developed and 1800 demonstrations on best package of practices for vegetable cultivation will be laid out at farmers fields. 40 ha area shall be brought under protected cultivation of vegetables.   Establishment of collection centres/ maintenance Performance is dependent on marketing board as same is being implemented by them 4. Sustainable agriculture through management of natural resources and soil health, organic and risk mitigation. Setting of Vermi compost Units Area under certified organic farms. Area under conversion to organic farming The department of agriculture is promoting organic farming in the state. The department has planned to set up 29500 vermi- compost units and 4100 new farmers shall be registered under organic farming and 970 hac area will be brought under certified organic farming and 1924 ha area under conversion i.e. conventional farming to organic farming.   Arable and Non-arable - treatment, construction of individual tanks, installation of MIS Achievement shall depend upon availability of sufficient funds under the schemes.. page : 12 of 17    Soil samples analysed Soil Health Card Issued (Soil health management) To Know the nutrient status of the soils, 125000 soil samples will be drawn and analysed in the soil testing labs and soil health cards will be issued to the farmers free of cost.   Propaganda and publicity for awareness through radio, TV, personnel contact etc. Implementation of contingent plan for Kharif Implementation of contingent plan for Rabi 2011-12 For the risk mitigation on account of vagaries of weather. damage by wild animals to the crops like wheat, maize, paddy, ginger, tomato, and potato etc, the department will notify WBCIS and NAIS during the Kharif and Rabi season respectively. The publicity of these schemes will be done through extension functionaries, AIR, Doordarshan and other media. In event of drought situation, contingent plans will be prepared by the department in consultation with SAU’s. 5. Research and developement support to develop human resources &increased growth in agriculture HRD developement Progress shall be reported by SAUs           6. Budget, sanctions and manpower Achievement of various targets as per RFD The achievement of success indicators/targets shall depend upon availability of adequate budget / issue of AA/ES in April and availability of manpower as per the sanctioned strength. page : 13 of 17 Results Framework Document (RFD) for Agriculture     (2011-2012)                                                                         Section 5:                            Specific Performance Requirements from other Departments Department Success indicator What do you need?
