The following is a random testimonial from a satisfied Window-Eyes customer. I have been using Window-Eyes for almost ten years now. I used Window-Eyes along with my scanner and OCR program to read all kinds of books. I like to read my favorite author's bestsellers. Another way I use my Window-Eyes is when I serf the Internet. It is my favorite thing to do when I'm on my computer. I can now research all of my family member's medications, and for me, that is a plus. Before I purchased Window-Eyes, my reading and shopping experiences were limiited. I use Window-Eyes to do online shopping and get those wonderful bargains! I just recently joined Facebook and I use Window-Eyes to keep in touch with all my friends and make new ones. Now, how cool is that? Thanks for a wonderful product and thanks to the tech support team.
