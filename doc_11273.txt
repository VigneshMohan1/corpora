Mr. Karsanbhai G Patel is the owner of the farm. Mango, lemon, amla and coconut trees were planted in a 6.5 acres (13 bigha) of virgin land which was converted into cultivation. Now the trees are 10 years old and bearing fruits. Last year in Mango crop about 500 munds were grown and done business worth Rs. 3 lakhs, (munds means 20 kgs). In lemon, Rs. 40,000 business was done. Due to pest attack the coconut and amla trees could not get success. Earlier, Mr. Karsanbhai tried intercropping by planting cotton, chillies, brinjals etc. But now he is concentrating primarily on four crops viz., mango, lemon, amla and coconut. Till last year, water was lifted from the river through flood irrigation method. This year, drip irrigation is installed and water is not a problem. Due to the use of chemical fertilizers, the shelf life of the fruit is longer and one can sustain till it is sold in the market. Fruits should be sold when it is ripe, whereas grains can be stored for longer period even if it is not sold. Mr. Karsanbhai says that even though I used chemical fertilizers but organic fertilizers is better. These days I am using Humic acid, Neem cake and Castor cake. In the long run organic fertilizers are advantageous. Though Mr. Karsanbhai G Patel belonged to farmer’s family, he came into agriculture field during the later stages of his life. He is an agriculture graduate. Before venturing into farming Mr. Patel was working in Bank of Baroda as an agriculture officer. He has put up 30 years of service in various positions of the bank. He worked as branch manager in many places. He was also worked as district planning for agriculture finance. He took up VRS in 2001. He has invested a part of the VRS fund in agriculture land and thus set his foot in farming. “I recovered by cost. My future plans are greenhouse farming and sericulture – honey bee and rabbit raring. This is my next five year plan,’’ he adds.  “Adequate storage facility and timely transportation is necessary for perishable vegetables.’’ he concludes.
