In the year 1860, silkworm breeders exported to European countries 6.064 kg of silkworm seed and in this period nurseries are established in order to produce material for mulberry plantations. In the past 50 years, the production of cocoons in Romania increased from around 500 tons (1944) to about 2000 tons (1989). After 1990, due to the change of the national economy through the transition from a centralized economy (communist) to a market economy, the changing forms of land ownership, the production of cocoons decreased year by year, reaching in 1998 a production of 3 tons raw cocoons per year and the Silk Spinning from Lugoj has ceased its activity. CURRENT STATE OF SERICULTURE The production of cocoons and raw silk is very low in Romania, almost nonexistent in the present, existing only a few breeders in the south of the country, and for the maintenance of the gene pool breedings are performed at S.C. SERICAROM S.A. Bucharest Baneasa and at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine from Cluj-Napoca. Research is conducted in several agricultural universities and research centers, as well as within the National Institute for Textiles and Leather from Bucharest. At the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca functions The Reference Centre for Advanced Research in Sericulture and Production of Silk Promotion (RCARS - PSP). This centre is organized as a research entity within The University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine (USAMV) Cluj-Napoca and has specialized personnel (teachers and researchers, PhD students and postdoctoral students) employed for an indefinite period, has a Biobase for research, laboratories equipped with latest generation research equipment and an auto laboratory for interventions in the field and other facilities. The equipment and logistics correspond at present to an international reference centre that meets the requirements of ISC and works in its interest.  Statistics Given the tradition and the ease of transactions with sericultural products, and although in recent years there have not been high productions of cocoons, Romania has not been absent from the silk market and has carried out import and export activities presented in the tables below.

Low interest of investors for the rural areas Resources The genetic patrimony is represented by 65 races of silkworm of the species Bombyx mori and 4 species of Philosamia ricini, being preserved at S.C. SERICAROM S.A. from Bucharest. The quality of the genetic material is high, and after the completion of the programs of improvement of the silkworms, the increase in the production of silk per box by 25% was achieved, of the silk weight by 15%, of the content in silky cover by 10.5%, and of the fibre length by 20%. Therefore there is the possibility to obtain high productions if the rearing technologies are respected. The current state of the mulberry tree varieties genetic heritage. The mulberry tree genetic heritage is also in the management S.C. SERICAROM S.A. and contains domestic and foreign varieties introduced in exploitation since the early national organization of sericulture. According to the data provided, there are in the patrimony 59 mulberry tree varieties out of which 10 are domestic and 49 foreign. This genetic material corresponds to the pedoclimatic conditions of our country, contains varieties with high resistance to frost and drought, presents robust growth, with high productions of leaf of the highest quality, adaptable to intensive type plantations. Outlook Romania has established a strategy for the revival and development of sericulture for the following period, developed at the level of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, proposed for debate and implementation throughout the country. The recovery of the Romanian sericulture production, exigency towards the quality of the fibre, aspect that influences the price of silk for silk processors and consumers, modernization and promotion of small and medium sericulture farms that should exploit by-products resulting from rearing, and last but not least, efficient sericultural marketing, are just some of the objectives that can reinvigorate this domain with potential for rural socio-economy. Given the huge potential that Romania offers for this domain, the fact that the growth technologies are environmentally friendly technologies and provide a sustainable development in the area, the implementation of the development strategy and revival of silkworm rearing and processing of primary and secondary products from this domain is required. At present, sericulture can be relaunched throughout the country due to the implementation of the strategy of silkworm rearing in family sericulture modules (FSM). These can use an improved biological material, benefit from the productive potential of the races and hybrids, and also of varieties of the mulberry tree created in the pedoclimatic conditions of our country, as well as the exploitation of silk cocoons spinning machines needed for the primary processing of silk. In view of the current sericultural potential of Romania, given the fact that it is not known precisely the existing surface of mulberry trees, it is proposed that, at country level, three areas of interest should be exploited, given the existence of some mulberry plantations, respectively the experience and interest in the development of a business in the field of silkworm rearing.
