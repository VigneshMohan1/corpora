FAO defines hunger as being synonymous with chronic undernourishment. The Millennium Development Goal hunger target measures the progress made by countries towards halving, between 1990-92 and 2015, the proportion of people suffering from undernourishment, or to bring this proportion below 5 percent. The World Food Summit target measures the progress made by countries towards halving the number of undernourished people between 1990-92 and 2015.

The report reviews progress made since 1990 for every country and region as well as for the world as a whole. Progress towards the MDG 1 target, however, is assessed not only by measuring undernourishment, or hunger, but also by a second indicator – the prevalence of underweight children under five yearsof age. Progress for the two indicators across regions and over time, is compared, providing insights into the complexity of food security. Overall progress not with standing, much work remains to be done to eradicate hunger and achieve food security across all its dimensions. The 2015 report not only estimates the progress already achieved, but also identifies remaining problems, and provides guidanceon which policies should be emphasized in the future. Key factors that have determined success to date towards food security and nutrition goals are identified. The list of factors – economic growth,agricultural productivity growth, markets (including international trade) and social protection – is by no means exhaustive. The report also shows how protracted crises, due to conflict or natural disasters, have deleterious effects on progress in hunger reduction. Notes Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the latest reported period. The same holds for population data of the United Nations. Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are advised to refer to changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of  The State of Food Insecurity in the World  and refrain from comparing data published in editions for different years. Countries, areas and territories for which there were insufficient or not reliable data to conduct the assessment are not reported.
