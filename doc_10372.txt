Grows paddy and pulses at Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh Goldensands Agrotech India was found by Mr. Ranganath Krishnan and a few friends near Doddaballapur. Currently in its initial set up, they plan to use GAP and cultivate cash crops. They wish to start with short-term crops such as musk melon, water melon etc to kick start cash flow. In the long term, Goldensands will cultivate mango, pomegranate orchards with medium term crop papaya as the intercrop. Among their vast crops, pomegranate is the highly profitable crop despite being the most difficult one. Demand for seeds and the fruit for direct consumption as well as juice manufacture makes it the favourable one of the lot. Goldensands is currently concentrating more on short term crops owing to immediate returns on investment. One of the critical project that Goldensands plans to explore alternatives for replacing sugar with stevia. Mr. Ranganath elaborates “Stevia Rebaudiana is a high potency sweetener for the growing natural food market. Because of unique composition, it is safe for diabetic since it does not affect blood sugar levels, it does not have any neurological or renal side effects of some of the artificial sweeteners. There are many other positives about stevia. It can be safely used as a sugar replacement in daily life”. Despite failed attempts made by farmers to make a profit from stevia earlier, Goldensands wishes to cultivate the same. There is an increase in demand for stevia in the current market owing to new processing plants that have emerged in the country. Besides increasing global demand for stevia is also an added reason Goldensands wishes to continue with its cultivation and dedicate a large chunk of land for this project. Goldensands hopes to make better profit by reducing the intervention of middlemen. “Government has setup many producer markets, where farmers can directly sell their produce instead of selling to middlemen. By reaching their produce to these markets, they can get better than they would get at farm gate” Mr. Ranganath adds. Goldensands do not export currently but plan to do so in the future when the right opportunity presents itself. Sharing the future plans for Goldensands Mr. Ranganath says “year 1 we would like to build our infrastructure and make it operational. Get the required staff both skilled and unskilled, and go live with our plans for short term crops. Long term, we would like to start vertical integration of our produce to ensure we maximize our returns”. Mr. Ranganath has a work experience of 23 years both in India and Middle East. A large part of it was spent working for information and financial services in the Gulf region. From 2010 he evaluated biomass, biofuels, algae and finally moved to agriculture.
