Microsoft Word - Dynamic Data Revision Policy_website Dynamic Data Revision Policy of DGCI&S According to the data revision policy adopted by DGCI&S while releasing the data of a particular month, the data of the previous months (both for principal commodities and 8-digit HS codes) will also be revised by taking into account the late receipted data in the respective months, which were received after the initial release of data for that month. This will establish comparability as monthly data, if added up from April to any particular month will tally with the cumulative figures shown against that month in the latest monthly data release. This revision policy has been implemented with effect from 2009-10.
