Approximately 5000 tons of fruits are used every year. These fruits are processed with modern equipment under state of art facilities. Farmers are trending towards organic inputs as neem has proved not only as a nutrient product but also as an excellent pest repellent. “We have people who visit farmers’ place, take on field demonstrations, and explain the benefits of organics products and also advantages of Neem based products. We have a facility where the farmers can see the process and then take the products,” Mr. Maneesh explains. For achieving the best output from neem based farming, neem based products should be applied in the soil during ploughing along with other fertilizers. SPS Organics wishes to create more awareness of the benefits for neem products not only in domestic but also in the international market.
