Go to the shop Shripad Consultancy Home Shripad Consultancy Identifies underground water level and location in fields using soil resistivity meter Vivek Vijay Pandit Shripad Consultancy was established in 2001 by Mr Vivek Vijay Pandit, the proprietor. It has been working for agricultural sector namely finding underground water and allied services like water harvesting. Based at Nashik, Maharashtra, the company uses a mechanism known as soil resistivity meter to carry out its entire work, which he claims is 90% accurate. The services offered are finding the best spot of water in a given area for tube wells, open wells or old open wells, to know the depth-wise classification of a given spot with accurate determination of underground rock/soil status and components of strata layers up to a depth of 350 feet, to trace out leakages of underground pipelines and storage tanks, to trace out the seepage of earthen dams, canals and percolation tanks to know the exact underground rock structure for civil engineering and to trace out the exact water harvesting/ recharging position. Mr Pandit outlines the advantages of using the soil resistivity meter method as he is able to determine a given area with regards to presence of water or air and wetness of the spot with 90% accuracy, to predict the geographical 2D representation of the land up to a depth of 300-350 feet, and also the status of the water bearing strata. The method can also examine the present open well/tube well water connection with the new prescribed water location and also suggest the position for water harvesting, recharging or percolating tanks. Mr Pandit explains that there are two types of soil resistivity meter methods namely the Wenner and the Schlumberger methods, both of which are mainly used for defining the strata. He continues, “First find the water position for 6 inch bore well and then go for the strata. This is the most effective and efficient way.” Soil resistivity meter method involves testing how much the soil resists the flow of electricity. In a layman’s word Mr Pandit explains using an example, when a man sits touching a wall and an electric wire carrying 230 v and 16 A current falls on the roof, then two situations arise, firstly in dry days the man is not affected by the current and secondly the man would be surprised during rainy days as the wetness of the wall increases. The ranges of customers as specified by Mr Pandit, who he feels, should avail their services, are Govt. organizations, NGOs, forest department and farmers. He feels that the company is working for agricultural sector because the way they communicate their services is not in technical engineering language but in that of local farmers’ language. Exemplifying their way of communication, he says if a ten feet diameters open well would give a minimum of 7 feet water or a bore well would give a minimum of 1 inch water a day, then only farmers should think of digging a well. Mr Pandit feels the awareness of knowledge related to underground water and the frustration of farmers are the biggest challenges, which, he says, he overcomes by having a parental attitude. Mr Vivek Vijay Pandit is a mechanical engineer and has experience in the field related to pump, industrial valve, pharmaceutical machinery and cnc or plc based machine manufacturing companies.
