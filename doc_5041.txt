Between 2005 and 2010, Indias share of global GDP increased from 1.8 to 2.7 percent, and 53 million people were lifted out of poverty. India is home to globally recognized companies in pharmaceuticals, steel, and space technologies, and the country is a leader in the use of information technologies for e-government and public service delivery. In line with these transformations, India is now among the top 10 percentile of fast growing nations and has become a prominent global voice. Progress on human development has been remarkable: life expectancy more than doubled from 31 years in 1947 to 65 years in 2012, and adult literacy more than quadrupled from 18 percent in 1951 to 74 percent in 2011. While India has made significant progress in reducing absolute poverty, it is still home to a third of the worlds poor people. Significant development challenges remain. Helping India address these challenges is central to the World Bank Groups goal of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.  See Less - Details Document Date 2014/10/01 Document Type Working Paper Report Number 91626 Volume No 1 Total Volume(s) 1 Country India ;  Region South Asia ;  Disclosure Date 2014/10/20 Doc Name India - Country snapshot Keywords absolute poverty, access to credit, access to education, access to finance, access to financial services, access to formal credit, access to markets, access to services ...   See More + accessibility, advisory services, advisory work, agricultural development, agricultural growth, agricultural productivity, agricultural products, Agricultural Services, air, air pollution, airports, basic needs, bridge, business development, business volume, Capacity Building, capital accumulation, Capital flows, Child Development, child mortality, climate change, commercial banks, community forestry, community groups, Community Institution, community institutions, community life, community organizations, consumer protection, cooperatives, crop insurance, crop yields, current account, debt, delivery models, deposit, deposits, diesel, disadvantaged groups, diversification, drainage, drinking water, drought, e-government, economic development, Economic Developments, economic growth, educational attainment, efficient transport, efficient transport system, elementary schools, emergency response, employment opportunities, enrollment, environmental degradation, environmental protection, ethnic groups, exchange rate, expenditure, expenditures, facilitation, farm productivity, farm technology, farmers, financial access, financial difficulties, financial product, financial service, financial services, financial sustainability, fiscal deficit, food entitlements, food grains, food products, food security, Foreign Direct Investment, Freight, Fuel, gender, Gender inequality, global partnerships, greater access, greenhouse gas, greenhouse gas emissions, health insurance, heavy reliance, high population density, highway, highway network, highways, household access, household survey, housing finance, human development, Human Development Index, income, income inequality, indebtedness, indicators of poverty, inequality, information technologies, Infrastructure Development, Infrastructure Investment, inland waterways, institutional capacity, Institutional Investors, International Bank, International Finance, irrigation, Job creation, labor market, land management, land markets, land use, levels of access, limited access, livable cities, livelihood opportunities, loan, malnutrition, market failures, medical expenses, microfinance, mobility, monetary policy, National Poverty, National Poverty Line, national poverty lines, nutritional status, old age, passenger traffic, persistent inequalities, poor, poor people, population density, Poverty Head, Poverty rates, poverty reduction, Poverty reduction efforts, private investment, Public Works, rail, rail transport, railway, railway system, Railways, reduction in travel, remote areas, risk management, risk reduction, road, road accidents, Road Development, Road Improvement, road infrastructure, road maintenance, road network, road safety, Road Sector, Road transport, rural, rural areas, rural communities, rural development, Rural Employment, rural energy, rural households, rural infrastructure, rural livelihoods, rural market, rural people, Rural poor, Rural poor households, rural population, rural poverty, rural road, rural roads, rural Transformation, rural water, rural water supply, safety nets, sanitation, savings, savings rate, self-employment, Small Business, Small Business Development, social enterprises, social responsibility, soil erosion, state highways, Statutory Liquidity Ratio, street lights, targeting, tax, technical assistance, technical support, toll, toll revenues, traffic, trains, transit, transit routes, transport, transport capacity, transport network, transport sector, transportation, travel time, union, urban areas, urban development, vehicle, village councils, villages, vulnerable households, vulnerable people  See Less - Language English Topics Rural Transport ;  Transport Economics ;  Poverty ;  Rural Roads ;  Transport ;  Historic Topics Transport ;  Poverty Reduction ;  Health, Nutrition and Population ;  Finance and Financial Sector Development ;  Historic SubTopics Population Policies ;  Transport Economics Policy & Planning ;  Banks & Banking Reform ;  Access to Finance ;  Rural Poverty Reduction ;  Unit Owning Director-General, Evaluation (IEGDG) Version Type Final See More + See Less - Downloads Complete Report in English Official version of document (may contain signatures, etc) Official PDF, 110 pages 7.7 mb TXT * *The text version is uncorrected OCR text and is included solely to benefit users with slow connectivity.
