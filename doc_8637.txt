In 2015 it will launch a common market comprising over 600 million people: the ASEAN Economic Community. To help ensure continued economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction, the region requires $60 billion in annual investments for road, rail, power, water, and other critical infrastructure. ASEAN nations possess over $700 billion in foreign exchange reserves, but these funds are being largely invested outside of the region. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF) is an innovative ASEAN initiative to mobilize the region's resources for its infrastructure development needs. The AIF supports ASEAN's Master Plan on Connectivity, which calls for a better-connected ASEAN region that brings people, goods, services and capital closer together.
