SASMIRA laboratories are recognized by International Bureau for Standardisation of Man-made fibre (BISFA), Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), American Association of Textile Chemist and Colourist (AATCC) & others. SASMIRA laboratory is accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) as per ISO/IEC 17025 – 2005 for Mechanical, Chemical and Biological evaluation of textiles. Although, NABL accreditation has recognition worldwide, but it only caters domestic exporters so the need was felt to have American accreditation for COE-Agrotech to expand our services to the International market. Hence, International accreditation has been attained from American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA), USA for Mechanical and Chemical testing of textiles and allied substrates.
