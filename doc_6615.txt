The Youth Council is comprised of 12 students who live and attend high school in Sanford. All students were open to apply at both of Sanford’s high schools, Crooms Academy of Information Technology and Seminole High School.  The 12 students, who now comprise the inaugural Mayor’s Youth Council, were chosen by their schools to participate. Youth Councils are an excellent means of vesting youth with the knowledge, skills and abilities in civic matters. Youth Councils promote regular and active civic engagement among youth.   “I am looking forward to this new endeavor for the City of Sanford. Engaging and investing in the next generation by educating them in the importance of civic involvement is integral to the future of our community. These students are willing and eager participants. I think the Youth Council students provide a great foundation of our future leaders”, said Mayor Triplett.   The goal of the Mayor’s Youth Council is to engage the youth of Sanford, to make recommendations to the City Commission on matters that affect this demographic and ultimately every citizen. The Council will pick a project to work on that aligns with the City of Sanford’s Mission and Vision, involving them in the policy-making process. The Youth Council will meet this summer and throughout the upcoming 2015-2016 school year.   “What an amazing opportunity Mayor Jeff Triplett is providing for our students.  This will provide these students with an up close and personal view of government at work!  We’re excited for this Youth Council, and so appreciative of the opportunity given Sanford’s students”, said Dr. Connie Collins, Principal, Seminole High School.   "Participating in the Youth Council allows students to become invested in their local government while giving them the opportunity to experience first-hand the impact they can have on the community they live in. This experience will help promote positive youth involvement and set the standard for future community service", said Dr. Demetria Hayes, Principal Crooms Academy of Information Technology.
