LA TRINIDAD, Benguet – Seven new online courses on Slaughter goat production is set to be offered through the e-Learning for agriculture and fisheries later this year. A training-workshop on e-Learning for module writers of the National Science and Technology Program on slaughter goat was conducted by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCAARRD) of the Department of Science and Technology and the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI). The training aimed to transform research results of goat products from State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) into e-Learning courses that can be accessed by more clienteles. The new content developers which are composed of academicians from various SUCs in the country include Dr. Patricia M. Barcelo and Janneth H. Delmendo of Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU), Aubrey Joy M. Balbin of Isabela State University (ISU), Dr. Emilio M. Cruz, Dr. Edgar A. Orden, Dr. Alvin P. Soriano, Jackielou R. Gallarde and Neal A. del Rosario of Central Luzon State University (CLSU), Dr. Lolito C. Bestil of Visayas State University (VSU), Dr. Carlito B. Sanchez and Prof. Elma G. Sepelagio of University of Southern Mindanao (USM) Dr. Ne B. Velasco and Jomar M. Maltu of Sultan Kudarat State University (SKSU). Slated this third quarter of 2015, new courses on goat will include stabilizing feed supply, feed supplements for different stages, inducing off-season estrus, AI for goat, slaughtering and cutting standards for goats, raising halal goat and goat waste management options. Currently there are four online courses on integrated slaughter goat production and management. These are designed for new and existing goat raisers who would like to elevate traditional goat keeping into a profitable slaughter goat enterprise. All these courses are self-study tutorials and are self-paced, allowing e-Learners to complete each course according to their schedule. The training-workshop was held at ATI-Regional Training Center - Cordillera Administrative Region in La Trinidad, Benguet last March 9 to 13, 2015.
