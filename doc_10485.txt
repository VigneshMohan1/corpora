Problem is, very harmful chemicals and pesticide come from food itself to human body,” she observes. Her mother suffered a heart attack in 2002 with 3 blockages and she took natural remedy, bottle gourd juice, instead of a bypass surgery. “This incidence was the big shift for me,” she shares, motivating her to get involved in organic food. She also launched ‘Swasthya World’ facebook page which focus on complete awareness activities in the city like organic farm visit, eco agro tourism, waste management, terrace gardening, organic catering, consultation, awareness programs on organic foods and wellness, healthy recipe, workshop etc. “We also have started ‘The real Green Café’, Pune’s first Vegan and semi organic Café,” she adds. The company started with 10-15 farmers initially trading commodities like rice, wheat and pulses. At present the figure has crossed 300. During later years, for some duration, the company procured all the organic food from a branded company named Morarka Foods Pvt. Ltd., Jaipur. She being an automobile engineer and her husband a commerce graduate, they attended a workshop, zero budget natural farming, and food, body & ecology course by Dr Vijaya Vyankats for nine weeks to learn about organic produce. They also got acquainted with organic farmers at the workshop. “I started meeting those genuine farmers since then, through their references met many other genuine farmers,” she shares. “Price mainly, but also the authenticity, trust, traceability is reason for improved sales,” Sheela shares, “We started with the sale of Rs. 5000/month slowly reached to 1Lac with the lot of struggle, experiments etc.” Today the store carries all major organic produce brands like 24mantra, pro nature and eco fresh etc. Sheela mentions the initial struggles as, “In 2007 owing to issues regarding transportation, quality, packaging, consistent supply, poor communication, responsibility and coordination etc. we closed our distribution centre with heavy losses.” For the same reason the company could not market the products of the local famers. “I tried to work out to market their products in my shop but could not,” she adds. At present she is also involved in a Farmers Brand called Mahaorganic Farmers Producer Company. Where in the farmers are the shareholders. “This is a common platform for all the organic farmers in Maharashtra, to synchronize and to channelize them to the consumers in all aspects,” she describes. Here the farmers will be verified as an organic farmer to get their products listed. “Personally, I want to be a contributor to this movement (organic) as networking person, as a channelizer,” she shares. She endeavours to bring a change to people’s mind-set and bring them closer towards organic food for the betterment of all.
