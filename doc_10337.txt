Located at Pune, Maharashtra Sanjeev Latkar DSK Group is a group of companies that handles construction, automobile, and accessory dealers.     Milkotronics was an existing company since 23 years. A joint venture of DSK group and Milkotronics a year and a half ago resulted in the formulation of DSK Milkotronics. DSK Milkotronics provides automated milking solution at various stages. Mr. and Mrs. B. S. Kulkarni and Mr. Sanjeev Latkar are the promoters of this joint venture. The company offers solutions to the farmer in cow shed till the milk dairy plant. It directly connects with the farmers at grass root level through milk collection centers, chilling centers, bulk milk cooler centers and the dairy head office. The company presents high-end solutions addressing the pain areas of farmers, where they need more transparency in terms of technology and returns at collection centers and dairy centers. A section on the company website interacts with people to understand their problems then based on the input received develops innovative solutions to address the pain areas. Among the many, the latest innovation introduced by the company is the Dairy Robo. This Robo is a complete milk collecting station. Farmers who bring milk in their individual kettles pour the milk in the 40l cans at the collection center. Most of the times it is observed that these cans are not cleaned and when the milk is poured, immediately the bacteria formation takes place thus reducing the quality of the milk. Hence a robotic arm at cleaning centers was provided by the company for a complete cleaning solution. This robotic arm also senses the quantity and quality of milk automatically. With no manual intervention the farmers are assured of transparency in the process. “Farmer places his kettle under our second robotic arm where it will do the collection process. The robotic arm senses the liquid level and also gives the quality parameters like fat, protein, density, temperature, added water content in the milk before the farmer. Based on the quantity and quality the amount is transferred to his banking account directly through smart cards,” Mr. Latkar adds. The company also has introduced electronic thaw meter which is used for artificial insemination in the industry. The electronic thaw meter used at shed level was developed to take care of the failure rate and bring the success rate to 100%. In the collection centers there are different versions of automatic milk collection units and USB that provide customized solutions. At the plant level they provide ERT Solutions. Different automation solutions are provided at every level to ease various issues faced by the farmer. Since the technology is inculcated in the root level, the quality of milk received will be high. Despite subsidies available for the products, most farmers are not aware of the same. Agencies such as NDDV conduct programs across the nation to generate awareness on the products. The company’s respective district wing also has its own chain for marketing products.  Mr. Sanjeev Latkar is an Engineer. Milkotronics was his first attempt at being an entrepreneur and the success of the company retained him in the field.
