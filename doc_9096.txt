TV penetration is almost 100%. Therefore adoption of technology is limiting factor. Availability of cost effective technology for small farmer is the problem.

Farming in India is mostly done by resource poor farmers. We run a Farmers\' School in the name of an innovative farmer Eldho Baby with idea of learning from farmer to farmer. Such kinds of schools should be visited by the scientists and agro-technicians and develop location specific and gender specific technologies. Multimedia tools like video are effective in reaching out youth farmers in particular.
