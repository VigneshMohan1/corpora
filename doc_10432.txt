All the products are sold under the brand name ‘Mahanidhi’. “As of now we are having sales focus on Delhi NCR but we want to spread across the country in future,” shares Mr. Chaudhary. Print media and multilevel marketing are the two modes used for boosting product awareness and sales. Kamdhenu project is another vertical of company. The project aims at producing high quality standard milk and milk products from its own cows and buffaloes. Women Power & Industrious Farmers are the main driving forces for the launch of the project. Farmers practicing organic horticulture and dairy farming can become part of the project. Anyone can join it; however it is more feasible for local farmers.
