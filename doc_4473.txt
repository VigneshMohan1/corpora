(1) COMMERCIAL & (2) CONFIDENTIAL will be carried out at Central Farm Machinery Training   and Testing Institute (CFMT&TI), Budni and other Regional Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institutes.   COMMERCIAL TESTS are for establishing performance characteristics of machines that are in or ready for commercial production. The following types of commercial tests will be undertaken :   Initial Commercial Tests  on  indigenous    or  imported   proto-type  machines ready  for commercial production. Batch Test  on  machines  which   have  already  undergone Initial Commercial Test and or are being manufactured commercially in the country. Test in accordance with OECD Standard Test Code shall be   undertaken  on the machines in commercial production on the specific   request  of  the  manufacturer/ applicant exclusively for export purposes.     CONFIDENTIAL TESTS are for providing confidential information on the performance of machines, whether ready for commercial production or not or to provide any special data that may be required by the manufacturer/applicant.   GENERAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING ALL TESTS Machines may be tested at the request in writing of the manufacturer/accredited importers referred to as "Applicant" herein-after.   Tests will be carried out at the discretion of the Director, Central Farm Machinery Training & Testing Institute, Budni or Director of any of the Regional Institutes, herein-after referred to as "Testing Authority" to whom application on prescribed form may be addressed. For testing of tractors, only Director, CFMT&TI, Budni will be recognized as "Testing Authority" for the whole country. All the tests will be conducted as per relevant BIS Test Code. If for any machine/ component the BIS test code is not available, the test procedure shall be framed by the Testing Authority whose decision shall be final.   The lumpsum amount of test fee wherever applicable or the estimated expenditure will be intimated to the applicant who will deposit it in advance through a Bank Draft drawn on the Bank mentioned in the application form in favour of the Director of the Institute. The test fee advance deposited in respect of the machine for which lumpsum testing charges have not been fixed will be adjusted at the end of test. The applicant shall deposit the balance charges, if any, in the manner indicated above, before test report is released. For the machines, where lumpsum testing charges have not been fixed, the testing charges shall constitute the following :  All charges on account of test fee, stores, fuel, oils, lubricants, spare parts, general stores, workshop charges, other items as laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture, labour over-heads incurred during the test shall be borne by the Applicant. If the tests are carried out at a place other than the premises of Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Budni or the Regional Institutes, all transportation charges to and from the place of test, travelling allowance/daily allowance of the staff, etc. shall be born by the Applicant. The machinery will be delivered by the applicant at the testing Institute. However, if the machinery has to be collected by the Testing Authority either from the Railway Station or from any other place, all charges incurred in transport upto the Institute shall be payable by the Applicant. If the machine is withdrawn from test, written permission of the Testing Authority will have to be obtained. In such case test fee plus all other expenditure as indicated above for test conducted shall be charged. For the machines where lumpsum testing charges have been fixed, entire test fee advance shall be forfeited in the event of their withdrawal from test.     The lumpsum test charges as and when revised by the Government      shall have to be paid by the Applicant from the date of their applicability,      even if after completion of the test, the draft test report has not been      released. Parts of assemblies of machines worn out or damaged during test shall be replaced/ repaired by the Applicant free of cost within the time specified by the Testing Authority. In case some parts are required by the Testing Authority for destructive tests, these shall be arranged free of cost by the Applicant.   In case, any services are provided by the Testing Authority, these will be charged for. The cost of fixtures etc. which are not normally available at the Institute and which are found necessary for working of the machine under test and all special stores items shall be borne by the Applicant. Parts and assemblies of machines worn out or damaged during the test may be handed over at the discretion of the Testing Authority only after the test report has been released. The applicant will make his own arrangements to collect the machine within one month of intimation by the Testing Authority.  If the applicant fails to remove the machine in this period, the applicant will be liable for payment of ground rent as fixed by the Testing Authority for a period not exceeding four months. After the expiry of 3 months, one month notice will be served on the applicant by the Testing Authority. If the applicant fails to remove the machine within this period, the machine will become the property of the Institute and may be disposed off by auction at the discretion of the Testing Authority.  If any un-patented machine or a machine in respect of which a proper application for patent has not been duly made, is submitted for test, it will not be published or disclosed to the public by the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, or Regional Institutes and the matter will be treated as confidential so that the right of the inventor or a person claiming through him to get a patent for a machine is not prejudiced. If in the course of testing a machine/component, any invention and/or developments originate from the officers of the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, the Government may at the discretion take out separate patents to protect the subject matter invented and/or developed.   If the test on a machine submitted for confidential test have been conducted as per relevant commercial test procedure in all respects, then on the request in writing of the applicant, the Testing Authority, after satisfying himself may permit conversion of nature of test from "Confidential" to "Commercial".     ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS GOVERNING COMMERCIAL TESTS If a machine is already in commercial production in India, the sample for batch test shall be new and be selected by the Testing Authority or his accredited representative at random from series production. No alteration/modification that would alter its practical performance shall be allowed thereafter.   If the test is related to some branch of development work on which the Testing Institute is engaged, the whole or any part of the test fee may be remitted with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture. No test fee or other charges will be levied for commercial testing of machines developed by research units for ICAR or other Semi-Government Organisations, Universities or State Government Departments.   The Commercial Test Report may be used commercially by the applicant and may be published in full without any alteration or omission. No extract or abbreviated version shall be published without the written approval of Testing Authority.   The applicant may mention in advertisement that the machine/component has been tested at the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Budni or Regional Institutes (as the case may be) and shall invariably quote the number of the Test Report in advertisement.
