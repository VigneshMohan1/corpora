Last March the company completes first year of its operation and its annual turnover is Rs. 5 lakh. Company is in mushroom farming and marketing across Kerala, Bangalore and some areas in Tamil Nadu state. Apart from mushroom farming the company gives technical training to aspiring mushroom cultivators in association with Kerala Agriculture University as a public private partnership basis. They trained around 30 self help groups in Palakkad district. Out of 30 trained people 18 of them have started mushroom farming in their own areas. The company also supplies quality seeds with buy back scheme. They also manufacture and supply organic manure. There are 3 types of mushrooms namely oyster mushroom, milky mushroom and button mushroom. Button mushroom needs a particular temperature like 18-19 degree Celsius and is grown only in the hilly areas. It cannot be grown everywhere, milky mushroom requires 90 percent humidity factor to grow. Mr. Jayshankar holds Masters in Fisheries Management. All these years he was in Netherlands working for a European company. He also worked in a company in Algeria. Mr. Jayshankar says “we have established 12,000 beds capacity of oyster mushrooms and 8,000 beds of milky mushrooms in our farm. We also have lab capacity of producing 5000 tonnes seeds a month. We want to expand our business through self help group people.’’ “The main challenge is availability of quality mushroom seeds. In the first year we tried procuring seeds from all over India, later on we decided to produce quality seeds in our lab,’’ adds Jayshankar.
