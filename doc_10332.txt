Located at Hosur, Tamil Nadu Dr. N. Barathi, an agriculture scientist is an expert in plant propagation by tissue culture and cultivation of plants. He has rich experience of 25 years. He is a founder director of Growmore Biotech.  It is based at Hosur, Tamil Nadu is certified by Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India and accredited by AQIS, Australia. High quality standards along with newest research findings are followed throughout the process of developing tissue culture plants which are then supplied to farmers and government departments across India. These plants are also exported to foreign countries like Dubai, Japan, Australia, Hawaii, Brazil and Malaysia etc. Growmore Biotech initially produced 10,000 plants a day and today has reached a production capacity of 1,00,000 plants a day.   It has infrastructure to produce over 10 million tissue cultured plants annually.  The laboratory uses sunlight in the growing rooms to reduce the cost of electricity. “We are using sunlight for last 10 years for growing plants naturally. Few other technological features developed has also helped us in reducing our electricity cost from Rs.5,00,000 to Rs.1,00,000”, informs Dr. Barathi. The excerpts: What is the basic requirement for tissue culture? A clean laboratory, efficient staff, excellent cost control practices, proper production plan and good marketing team ensure successful propagation of tissue culture. How does the process of plant production work? Grow More has both contracted production of plants as well as their own propagation. The company predicts the market and starts propagating plants. In case of no contract, farmers are expected to confirm their requirements two to three months in advance. Growmore has 1 acre for the laboratory facility and 10 acres for greenhouse facility for primary hardening and secondary hardening. What is the mortality rate of tissue culture plant? The mortality of tissue culture plants depends on how well the plants are grown in the laboratory and in the greenhouse. It also depends on the transport and after care given in the field. What are the future prospects of tissue culture plants? The market for tissue culture plants are growing in new plant species and saturating existing plant species. What are the future prospects of tissue culture plants? The market for tissue culture plants are growing in new plant species and saturating existing plant species. What are the advantages and disadvantages of tissue culture? Tissue culture plants are free from diseases, have uniform maturity, new varieties are available immediately and exporting of plants involves minimal effort. However there are also a few disadvantages. The main problem in tissue culture is contamination of plants leading to rejection, cost of electricity leading to increase in cost of production and lack of awareness of products with Indian farmers. What post harvest precautions should be taken? For domestic market, the plants either could be primary hardened (15 gms per plant) or secondary hardened in polybag (1 kg.) and height 1 foot. The ex-agar plants need to be cared for much more and grown in another polybag. For exports it is always packed in card board boxes while for the domestic market it is either cardboard boxes or 5000 plants per lorry load. Are there tissue culture plants available for medicinal plants? Growmore supplies medicinal tissue culture plants. “We supply medicinal plants on contract to companies. A few years ago we worked jointly with VIGIROM – a Bangalore based company doing extraction of aromatic oils. The yield of tissue culture medicinal plants compared to normal in terms of active principle component and quantity is higher which entirely depends on the breeding and selection of the right clone,” informs Dr. Barathi. Is it possible to develop safed musli tissue culture plant? Growmore has not yet started the propagation of tissue culture safed musli, though it carried out research on it. It is a good technology to increase the yield of safed musli, however the tubers are formed after 2 seasons of growing. The safed musli tissue culture can increase the yield of safed musli by 200 to 400 % from the present yield. It will be successful only when collaboration with existing marketing companies of safed musli is established. Dr. Barathi says, “it can be done, if the requirement is more than 2 to 3 lakhs plants and we can provide hardened plants for Rs.5 per plant for orders above 10 lakh plants.” What is your annual turnover? Growmore clocked an annual turnover of Rs.3.8 crore last year and this year it is expected to be Rs.5.5 crores. “Our total investment in plant and machinery was Rs.3 crores, Rs.1 crore on land and Rs.1 crore is our working capital,” avers Dr. Barathi Read complete presentation at – http://bit.ly/13PITlY Our Correspondent Contact Details- Growmore Biotech Ltd. #41-B, SIPCOT Phase-II, Hosur – 635 109.
