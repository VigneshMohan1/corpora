The promoters of the company are Mr. George Eapen and Mr. Jamie Zerfas.  The company specializes in electric fencing products and solutions to protect crops. Mr. Eapen discusses the importance of safety guidelines and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification to electrical fencing. Commenting on farmer awareness about the importance of BIS certification, he says, “Farmers are consumers and ignorance of the law is no excuse, if the consumer is sued on account of fatality. High voltage (8-10KV) DC pulsed electric fences can also be potentially dangerous if not regulated,” adding, “The farmer is the ultimate consumer and he alone is held accountable for the safety of his farm protection equipment, erected in the public domain or in wildlife areas.” Guidelines on Safety of Electric fencing Mr. Eapen explains, “Electric fence energizers are classified by the BIS under household and similar electrical appliances. The consumer does not need any local body permission to use any household electrical appliance which carries BIS markings (formerly ISI mark), as it assures the consumer of personal safety. Safety of electric fences erected on the perimeter extends beyond personal safety, involving safety of neighbors, domestic animals, and wildlife, and hence would be mandatory.” Reasoning why the farmers buy uncertified systems, Mr. Eapen says, “Most companies exploit the farmers’ lack of knowledge and offer uncertified systems. Some companies sell electric fences on the basis of a test report issued by CPRI (Central Power Research Institute) or ETDC (Electronic Testing and Development Corporation). However, these test reports state clearly that the report is valid only for the sample tested and cannot be used to sell a hundred such un-certified units,” He adds, “The Central Government has to issue guidelines to regulate the display and sale of such potentially dangerous, high voltage equipment in the public domain, as uncertified equipment will eventually be deployed in remote areas of different states, by the unsuspecting farmers.” BIS vs. ISO 9001 – 2008 Some companies con the farmers stating that they have ISO 9001-2008 certification, trying to confuse farmers with ISI / BIS safety standards. Some other companies offer old permission letters from the Chief Electrical Inspectorate-TN (CEIG). The advisory from the CEIG to the Dean, TNAU and the CCF- TN Wildlife clearly states that it is mandatory for such articles to have BIS certification. Explaining the difference between ISO 9001-2008 certification and BIS certification, Mr. Eapen says, “ISO 9001-2008 is only a certification that concerns the organization and its management systems, while BIS concerns the safety of the product. Some manufacturers seek to mislead farmers by equating ISO with ISI markings, which is familiar to a farmer/consumer.” BIS 302-2-76 has endorsed standards laid down in the international standard IEC 335-2-76, referred to as IEC-60335 since 2008. EN-60335 is the standard followed to ensure conformity to European Norms (EN). CE marking assures complies to European (CE) norms. “Fenzgard has EN and CE safety markings on each energizer, with printed or embossed serial numbers,” maintains Mr. Eapen.
