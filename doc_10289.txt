Go to the shop Biomaxnaturals Home Biomaxnaturals Better yield, quality and soil fertility promises multipurpose bio-fertilizer ‘Life’ Dr. Arun Kulkarni Biomaxnaturals, based in Thane, Maharashtra offers bio-organic fertilizers and phytochemicals. It was established in 1998 by Dr. Arun Kulkarni. The vision of manufacturing bio-organic farming inputs took shape when the founder realized the damages happening to agricultural soils across the globe due to uncontrolled use of chemical fertilizers. These fertilizers have adverse effects on soil fertility leading to inadequate supply of food for the population. Since its inception, the company has developed various products towards this cause. The multipurpose bio-fertilizer ‘Life’ produced by the company resulted in over 20% increase in maize yields and 18% increase in sugarcane yields. It resulted in over 400% increase in the yields of the Chrysanthemum flowers. Results on the row crops are seen in about 7 days by change in color, which turns dark green. Increase in yields can be confirmed at the time of harvesting. Results with flowers or fruit trees can be measured during the first pluck after use of the bio-fertilizer Life. Curcumin is a phytochemical which is another major product offered by the company. It is extracted from agricultural produce and offered as a raw material for formulation of heath care products or nutraceuticals. Biomaxnaturals  also offers liquid concentrated bio-fertilizers, liquid natural foliar fertilizers, granular bio-fertilizers, spreader and sticker. “We strive for quicker results at lower costs,” shares Dr. Kulkarni. To make the most of the company’s products, Dr. Kulkarni emphasizes the following: • Follow the user instruction properly. • Use the products either in the early morning or late afternoon. • Maintain adequate moisture content in soil when applying to soils. • When using as spray, ensure complete wetting of the leaf surface on both sides. • Try on small segments of the farm before using on the entire farm. “Unit cost of chemical fertilizer may be lower than organic fertilizer but the total cost considering dosages, labor cost, and water requirements minimize the difference,” Dr. Kulkarni adds. Soil fertility factor which is not tangible needs to be considered. Residues of chemical fertilizers have adverse effect on fertility, which is not the case with organic fertilizers. This has direct effect on the yields after a few years. The Returns on Investments then start falling. A combination of both wherever recommended by the agri-experts after soil and leaf analysis may be an approach worth considering. In the future, the company plans to develop bio-fertilizers and phytochemicals for cold climate countries. Dr. Kulkarni holds a Doctorate in Biochemistry, and has done a post-doctoral project in Faculty of Agriculture, Ehime University, Japan. He worked as a research scientist and research fellow with various companies before establishing Biomaxnaturals.
