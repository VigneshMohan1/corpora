Presently, he is working as Marketing Head with Hahnemann Charitable Mission Society (HCMS) at Jaipur. Stevia, also known as sweet leaves, is 30% sweeter than the natural sugar. It is a good source of insulin in human body.  Stevia, the low carbohydrate sweetener, is available in four forms in the market namely fresh leaves, dry leaves, powder and liquid. It can be grown anywhere in any soil types. In India about six varieties of stevia are grown.  The life cycle of this crop is five years. In one acre, 30,000 plants are required initially and every year four cuttings are done. From the four cuttings 2000 kgs of dry stevia leaves is procured. “It grows very well using drip irrigation system. The pH of soil should be between 6-8. The cost of cultivation is approximately Rs. 1 lakh per year for one acre of stevia cultivation”, informs Mr. Chaturvedi. The annual maintenance cost works out to Rs. 30,000 per acre. The total production annually would be 200 kgs per acre. The buyback rate varies from Rs. 170-200 per kg. Visit http://bit.ly/19iSWBY for complete discussion.
