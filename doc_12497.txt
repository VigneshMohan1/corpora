" ( Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2002 ). Scientific research is an interdependent process whereby each experiment is informed by the results of others. The scientists who perform research and the professional societies that represent them have a great interest in ensuring that research results are disseminated as immediately, broadly and effectively as possible. Electronic publication of research results offers the opportunity and the obligation to share research results, ideas and discoveries freely with the scientific community and the public. ( Bethesda Statement on Open Access, 2003 ) Open-access literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. What makes it possible is the internet and the consent of the author or copyright-holder. ( Peter Suber, 2004 ). All the researchers working on medicinal and aromatic plants are cordially invited to be members of the MAPAI society and support the cause of Open Access. For Membership Details Please Click Here.
