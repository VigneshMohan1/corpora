Determining the exact location to dig a bore well to tap underground water in a farm is critical for a farmer. Despite technological advancement and availability of geo-physical surveys, many farmers still depend on the traditional water divining techniques. But are there economical and reliable scientific methods available to average farmers to help them determine the exact location to dig bore wells? AgricultureInformation.com forum members discuss the various options available to the farmers. Mr. Mahesh B and his father own a farm at Melur (30 kms from Madurai, Tamil Nadu). After extensive deep boring they couldn’t find water on their farm. They consulted two water diviners to determine where to dig. “We have a well. We bored 4 times but didn’t get any water. Please help us to find water using scientific technique,” he urged. Member Agrosysindia advises, “Scientific methods are available. Please contact the Water Board in Madurai. They will pass electricity in one end and receive the other end, with this they can analyze and assess the availability of water. That is the best method of finding water.” Mr. Kishan, who has a farm in Medak near Hyderabad, is also facing the problem of locating groundwater in his farm. He says, “In last past few years we dug nearly 7 bores in my fields, 5 failed, while in 2 we got some water. Now we have combined both. Please tell us how to find the ground water scientifically.” Mr. E. Murugesan opinionates, “Till now there is no 100% assured apparatus to find out the underground water. In India, the Geologists use resistivity meter, which indicates the performance of the underground soil. With the available calculations, they only assume that there may be water available at a level. No one can assure you to give exact depth and exact amount of water resources. China has done several inventions to solve the problem. But they also can’t give 100% result. Apart from borewell you can try open well. I had done several researches in this regard.” Mr. Pratheek differs, he says, “I have 25 years of experience in the field of investigating groundwater by geological method (hydrogeology & geophysical survey). After the study of the area I can suggest whether to drill a borewell. Depending on the water potential at a point, I suggest drilling bore wells.” Mr. Danielr suggests trying rain water conservation on farm lands that do not have water. Mr. T. S. Badrinarayanan, geoscientist, explains, “Nobody can give 100% guarantee for water. We cannot say about the confirmed availability of water. It is nature’s gift. Resistivity technique is an indirect way of delineating the subsurface rock formations. Frankly telling, no advanced technique of accurately locating water pockets is not available anywhere in the world and is yet to come. The resistivity techniques explore the subsurface rock formations, and the presence of fractures and gaps in rocks. The success depends on so many factors, mainly the experience.” He adds, “Since we are over exploiting the ground water resources, we must conserve water and water resources have to be improved by ground water recharging techniques. But it should be done properly, for which also we are advising.” He further adds, “Water quantum, conservation and water qualities are the important parameters. ========================================= Mr. T. S. Badrinarayanan – B2 Geotech Services Offers services to find groundwater and analysis of soil. Based at Kollidam, Tamil Nadu B2 Geo Tech was established in 1992 at Kollidam, Nagai district, Tamil Nadu. Mr. T.S.Badrinarayanan, a geoscientist is the proprietor of the company. “I have recommended over 8000 bore wells in India. The success rate is as high as 85-90%. Mineral explorations for quartz, granite and lime stones have also been done. Apart from it I have also geotechnical investigation for the construction of railway bridge qacross river Kollidam in Tamil Nadu,” says Mr. Badrinarayanan. The agriculture specific related services offered by B2 Geotech are mainly related to groundwater, soils nature and subsurface soil. He says, “Since water being the main source for agriculture, it definitely plays a vital role. Especially in hard rock areas it is difficult to get good water supply. Our role is very important in such places.” He adds, “Ground water being the viable alternative for water resources for irrigation, the hydro geologist’s role in pinpointing the potential ground water pockets is highly beneficial to farmers that too in a short duration of time we are helping them. Economically also we are advising the farmers to restrict the depth of bore wells by adopting scientific techniques. In future by adopting advanced techniques and instrumentation, he is planning to increase the success rate over 90%. Mr. Badrinarayanan says, “B2 is planning to help the farmers’ community by conducting awareness camps and exhibitions pertaining to the ground water resources and its conservation. We had a good interactive sessions especially with the rural agriculturists. Since many farmers are not aware of such scientific techniques, we are planning to have good interactions with the farmers. Since we mainly concentrate our ground water investigations for irrigation purpose we have good future plans to educate the remote area farmers.” Mr. Badrinarayanan is a post graduate in geology and has done PG diploma in Hydrogeology. “I have been doing the ground water, hydrogeological, mineral and geotechnical investigations since 1977. I have contributed about 25 research papers on ground water, hydrogeology and mineral explorations,” he adds.

We can say about the quality of water- The electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, PH, etc., also are governing factors for the good crop yield. In this way our techniques do help them a lot.” In conclusion, Mr. Badrinarayanan advises, “Use scientific approach for the best success rate to get water. Farmers should not drill bore wells unnecessarily by using unscientific methods, thereby saving time and money. In scientific techniques, if the investigation results are not favorable, we will not advise to drill bore holes unnecessarily. Farmers can benefit this way.” Join the discussion at – http://bit.ly/11o1L9P Source : Agriculture & Industry Survey Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 5+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > How to find ground water?
