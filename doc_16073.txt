INVESTMENT IN DEBENTURES OF STATE LAND DEVELOPMENT BANKS The Scheme for “Investment in the Debentures of State Land Development Banks” is a continuing plan scheme and has been in existence since 1966-67 (Third Five Year Plan). The SLDBs/SCARDBs raise resources for long term lending to cultivators by floating debentures which are trustee securities, as authorized by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) from time to time. The debentures floated by SLDBs/SCARDBs are subscribed by NABARD by way of refinance support, concerned State Governments, Government of India and other financial institutions. The Special Development Debentures are floated for minor irrigation; horticulture/plantation, farm mechanization, land development, wasteland, rural housing, Rural godowns, non-farm sector and animal husbandry etc. While switching over to loan system, NABARD has decided to limit the quantum of refinance to SCARDBs uniformly at 90% of total loans issued and the balance of 10% refinance support from Central & State Governments on 50:50 basis by way of investment in the debentures of SCARDBs as before. The share of Government of India worked out to about 5% in respect of Special Development Debentures. 2.
