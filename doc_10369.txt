Practices vedic methods in farming. Also develops unique mixed herbs “In 2008, a Japanese monk who lives in India gave me a book “The One Straw Revolution”. After reading it, I got the self-motivation to start an organic farm to grow rare herbs,” in this way Mr. Anil Kumar Sawhney took up farming in parallel to his on-going occupation of industrial consultancy for environmental management and performance improvement. He established Godson Organic Farm which is home to more than 100 rare herbs, all having distinctive medical significance. “We are mainly working on herbs useful in ailments for which there are no sure shot medicines available, like liver problems, heart ailments, cancer, immune boosters and sports medicines,” says Mr. Sawhney. A few rare herbs to name are – Medohara: useful against cholesterol; Shwasahara: useful in asthma, bronchitis; Gulma: useful in abdominal tumor; Aruchi: useful in anorexia. The list goes on. At the farm, vedic methods are adopted at every stage right from sowing, cutting, cleaning, drying and grinding. It also involves executing appropriate harvesting and processing techniques along with growing complimentary crops. Farming inputs used are green manuring; crop residue (straw) is directly mixed into the soil; farm extracted neem oil is used as pest repellant. Mr. Sawhney explains, “Green manuring is the technique of recharging the soil. After the harvesting, the sesbania or sun hemp or mungbean are sown. After a period of around 2 – 3 months the whole crop is directly ploughed in the soil. This gives high nutrition to the soil.” Rest he says nature cycle is maintained at the farm. 100% pure organic environment boosts the natural medicinal properties of the herbs. All parts of the herbs are having some sales worth and are sold off before hand. Local herb dealers visit farm almost twice a week for some or the other product, depending upon its maturity for plucking. “By God’s grace, we have never approached buyers as they are themselves coming to our farm. They trust upon us for the purity and perfection,” shares Mr. Sawhney and adds, “In future we have plans to set up our own extraction plant and sell the extracts to herbal medicine manufacturers.” Mr. Sawhney takes deep interest in developing mixed herbs where two different flavored crops if complimentary in nature are merged into one like ‘lemon-pudina’. “There is no specific formula but just inspired by my intuitive intelligence, I select the varieties,” he informs. The technique behind it is right selection of season, temperature and humidity conditions, and soil moisture. Other than that the most important factors remain to be the action of natural pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds. He adds, “Sometimes molecules do not mix properly when grown separately but some of them give better results if mixed herbs are produced naturally. Lot of R&D has to be done in this field.” The motivation behind creating new varieties is to serve as a mixture of great utility in daily life and fetch high revenue to the growers. “I do not depend or rely on any external source. Our fields are our R&D laboratories. For final analysis also we are doing in-house testing. We are establishing a test lab for chemical analysis of various herbs. The lab shall be operational within next month,” shares Mr. Sawhney. Lemon- pudina, and multi-spice tulsi are fetching good revenues while other products are in R&D stage. The focus is on creating a single herb for overall body toning – immunity, and anti-ageing. Mr. Sawhney invested his life time savings to purchase approximately 40 acres of land in village Tigra of District Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh) in 2010 and started doing organic farming. At Godson Organic Farm apart from the rare herbs, 12 varieties of perfumed rice, high medicinal value Himalayan brown rice, turmeric, mustard, sesame, lentil, mung bean, urad bean, wheat, and pulses are cultivated. He did his graduation in Mechanical Engineering and Lead Auditor course in QMS. After working as QMS consultant and auditor for 15 years he started his industrial consulting business. He is working 18-19 hours a day just giving 50% time share to both farm and consulting business. Sharing his future plans he concludes, “We plan on motivating other farmers to mark at least 10% of their land holding for organic herbal farming. Also we plan for exports of these premium products.” Contact details- Godson Organic Farm City Office – 1048, Janakpuri, Bareilly 243122 (U.P.) India Farm – Godson Organic Farm, Village Tigra, P.O.
