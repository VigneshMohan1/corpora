Indian Government led by Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has taken proactive measures to provide support to Nepal in this national disaster. As members of Indian Industry, it is our responsibility to join hands with our Government to extend relief measures to Nepal in this time of distress. FICCI President has already agreed to provide perennial supply of water and to begin with 5000 bottles are being arranged to be despatched. I am writing to request you all to please let us know how you could contribute towards this effort. Immediate requirements post disaster would be processed food, baby food, water, blankets, tents, OTC drugs. We are also in touch with the Government to obtain a priority list of materials. You may also consider making financial contribution in name of FICCI - SEDF which will be used for relief/rehabilitation. This is the charity arm of FICCI and all contributions will be eligible for tax deduction under sec 80 G. I further request you to advice your office to indicate manner in which you would like to contribute towards this cause.
