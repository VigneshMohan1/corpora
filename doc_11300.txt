Go to the shop Yaaganti Seeds – hybrid seeds Home Yaaganti Seeds – hybrid seeds Engaged in research,  production and marketing of hybrid seeds across the country Yaganti Venkateswarlu Yaaganti Seeds Pvt Ltd was incorporated in 1996 at Hyderabad by Mr. Yaganti Venkateswarlu and his wife Ms. Aparna. The company is headquartered in Hyderabad. The company specializes in maize, cotton and paddy. It preserves all the seeds in hired cold storages. “Due to our single-minded focus on developing corn hybrid seeds, we became the sixth largest corn hybrid seed marketer in India by 2003,”says Mr. Venkateswarlu. The company sells its products under the brand name Laxmi Seeds. The total volume of the hybrid seeds produced from the company’s parent seed is of 13,500 MT (considering the parent seed sales for 10,000 acres). The company has itslargest client base is in Karnataka. Quality Control The quality parameters defining the seeds are germination, genetic purity, physical purity and moisture content. “Quality is the most important parameter for growth. Hence the company makes all out efforts to ensure best quality in parent seeds as well as hybrid seeds, which are marketed. The quality of the company’s hybrid seeds can be compared with the best in the world. To ensure quality the company subjects the seeds for lab as well as field tests in four replications and mercilessly rejects the seeds, which are found to be substandard,” maintains Mr. Venkateswarlu. R & D The company has its R & D centre at Hyderabad spread over 16 hectares. “We have 20 qualified and experienced breeders and assistants work relentlessly under the guidance of Mr. M. N. V. RatnajiRaoand Dr. SontiVenkateswarlu. The company has germplasm bank with about 1,000 lines in corn, 100 lines in sunflower, 250 lines in millet and about 500 lines in vegetables like okra chilly, tomato and watermelon. The company is in the process of establishing Bio-Technology Lab for developing new hybrids through marker assisted selections/marker aided breeding,” avers Mr. Venkateswarlu. GM Seeds Speaking about the advantages of genetically modified seeds, Mr. Venkateswarlu says, “GM seeds have superior traits in insect resistance, weedicide tolerance, drought tolerance and thus more beneficial to farmers to get better returns. The opposition for these is there because the testing facilities to detect harmful effects of GM seeds are not available in the country and it is the fear of harmful effects that’s driving the anti GM campaign.” Domestic Seeds Industry Comparing the domestic seeds industry with the international seeds industries, Mr.Venkateswrlu says, “Our domestic industry is robust and domestic players occupy no. 1 position in crops like cotton, jowar, paddy, sunflower, and many vegetable crops. MNC companies are leading in maize, bajra and hybrid paddy. Private research is stronger than public research of seeds which is evident by the fact that more than 80% of consumption of private research hybrids in the country. Our domestic players have the local knowledge and dedicated research teams to counter MNC dominance.” Promotion of Seeds Industry Suggesting ways to accelerate the growth of the industry, Mr.Venkateswarlu says, “Public – private partnership should be encouraged for developing both GM seeds and traditional hybrids (government has huge infrastructure but is under-utilized.), soft loans should be extended for infrastructure development like processing plants and cold storages; and exports should be promoted by undertaking testing of private hybrids in different countries.” The government has taken several measures to promote growth of the seeds industry, “Offering50 % subsidy (to the extent of Rs. 50 lakhs) for constructing processing plants, cold storages, and making available the germplasm developed by various agricultural universities are a few steps taken  by the government for the development of the industry,” informs Mr. Venkateswarlu. The company aims to achieve a turnover of Rs 100 crores by the financial year 2013-14. Mr. Venkateswrlu is a graduate in agriculture and worked for Mahyco Ltd, ITC Ltd and Zuari Industries Ltd in their hybrid seed divisions for 15 years before starting Yaaganti Seeds.
