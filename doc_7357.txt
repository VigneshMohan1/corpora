The purpose of aggregation is to integrate primary producers in the value chain and enhance incomes through increased access to investments, technology and markets. At the same time, SFAC seeks to create networks of FPOs (both new and existing) at each State level to leverage their collective bargaining power for backward and forward linkages. As part of the process of consultation to create the State level forums, SFAC is hosting a series of Roundtable Conferences to discuss issues and challenges facing FPOs. Each RTC brings together FPO leaders, Government officials, banks, NGOs and private sector representatives to discuss challenges and solutions to the many issues facing FPOs. Proceedings of the various RTCs are posted below for public information. Responses to the comments and discussions at the RTCs may be mailed at sfac@nic.in . Relevant inputs may be posted on this website after suitable editing.
