It is a useful forum for holding consultation with the stakeholders, i.e., the pensioners through their Associations. It provides the Associations an opportunity for raising their problems directly before the concerned Ministries, as the officials of these Ministries are also present in the meeting. It also provides valuable feedback to the Government for effective implementation of the programmes and gives direction for the future course of action. It has maintained a healthy tradition of constructive discussion. SCOVA Notifications
