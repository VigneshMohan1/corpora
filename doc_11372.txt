Functions of organic matter Organic matter improves the physical condition of the soil, particularly the structure. Decaying organic matter acts as a food material for bacteria, fungi and other organisms. Presence of organic matter dissolves many insoluble soil minerals and make them available to plants It plays an important role in the nutrient supplying power of soil as it has got high cation exchange capacity (CEC) It increases the water holding capacity of the soil, particularly in sandy soils. It improves aeration and infiltration in heavy soils. It reduces loss of soil by water and wind erosion It regulate soil temperature It serves as an important source of certain plant of food element (N, P, S etc). The buffering nature of the organic matter is considered to be advantageous in the residue management of pesticides, herbicide and other heavy metals.   | Home | Seasons & Varieties | Tillage | Nutrient Management | Irrigation Management | Weed Management | Crop Protection | Cost of Cultivation | © All Rights Reserved.
