The necessity of launching such a mission was felt in view of the fact that less than two-thirds of the households in the country have access to banking facilities even after 67 years of independence. The Mission seeks to provide all households in the country, both rural and urban, with access to the financial services, like bank account with RuPay Debit card, access to credit, remittance, Insurance & Pension. Thus, the Mission not only brings the excluded sections into the financial mainstream but makes the transfer of benefits of various subsidy schemes of the government more efficient. To achieve the objectives of the Mission we would require full support from Banking and other Financial Institutions, private service providers and above all, citizens. I am sure together we shall succeed in improving the financial status of the downtrodden and poor of our country.
