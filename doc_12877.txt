There are three cytotypic forms distinguished by chromosome number, a diploid form, an infertile triploid form, and a tetraploid form. The triploid form is the most common and is thought to have arisen relatively recently in the himalayan region through hybridisation of the diploid with the tetraploid, whereas the tetraploid is thought to have arisen through autopolyploidy of the diploid (possibly more than once). Currently the taxonomic position of these forms are contested.
