Till 1970s, country used to import massive quantities of cotton in the range of 8.00 to 9.00 lakh bales per annum. However, after Government launched special schemes like intensive cotton production programmes through successive five-year plans, that cotton production received the necessary impetus through increase in area and sowing of Hybrid varieties around mid 70s. Since then country has become self-sufficient in cotton production barring few years in the late 90s and early 20s when large quantities of cotton had to be imported due to lower crop production and increasing cotton requirements of the domestic textile industry. Since launch of "Technology Mission on Cotton" by Government of India in February 2000 significant achievements have been made in increasing yield and production through development of high yielding varieties, appropriate transfer of technology, better farm management practices, increased area under cultivation of Bt cotton hybrids etc. All these developments have resulted into a turn around in cotton production in the country since last 6/7 years. The yield per hectare which was stagnant at about 300 kg/ha for more than 10 years, has increased substantially and reached a level of 554 kg/ha in cotton season 2007-08. The fundamental changes that taking place in the realm of cotton cultivation in the country, are having the potential to take the current productivity level near to the world average cotton production per hectare in the near future. Apart from meeting the increased cotton consumption by domestic textile industry, country may have sufficient surplus cotton to meet the cotton requirements of importing countries. Progress with regard to area, production and yield in the country over the last ten years is enumerated as under: Area, Production and Yield for last Twelve years: Area in lakh hectare/Production in lakh bales/Yield kgs per hectare Year Area in lakh hectares Production in lakh bales Yield kgs per hectare 2000-01 85.76 140.00 278 2001-02 87.30 158.00 308 2002-03 76.67 136.00 302 2003-04 76.30 179.00 399 2004-05 87.86 243.00 470 2005-06 86.77 241.00 472 2006-07 91.44 280.00 521 2007-08 94.14 307.00 554 2008-09 94.06 290.00 524 2009-10 103.10 305.00 503 2010-11 111.42 325.00 496 2011-12 121.78 353 493 2012-13* 116.14 334 489 Source: Cotton Advisory Board * Projected State-wise Area, Production and Yield for last ten years: Cotton Balance Sheet: Based on the cotton production in the country and its consumption by different segments of domestic textile industry, Cotton Balance Sheet for the current cotton season 2012-13 vis-à-vis 2011-12 as drawn by Cotton Advisory Board, is given hereunder: Quantity in lakh bales of 170 kgs Item 2012-2013 2011-2012 Supply Opening Stock 28.56 45.77 Crop Size 334.00 353.00 Imports 12.00 12.00 Total Availability 374.56 410.77 Demand Mill Consumption 230.00 217.68 Small Mill Consumption 20.00 21.63 Non-Mill Consumption 20.00 14.09 Total Consumption 270.00 253.40 Exports 70.00 128.81 Total Disappearance 340.00 382.21 Carry Forward 34.56 28.56 For Cotton Balance Sheet for the last eleven years Quick Links About Us Open List Hon'ble Minister of State Textiles (Independent Charge) CCI - An Organisation Board of Directors Highlights of Achievements Objectives Operations Network Procurement of Kapas Sale of Cotton Financial Performance Brief note on Financial Performance Ten Year Financial Result Annual Report Developmental Activities National Cotton Scenario Current Cotton Scenario Press Releases CSR Statistics Vigilance Citizens Charter Right to Information Act Technology Mission on Cotton (TMC) Property Return (Immovable) Lokayukta Return Public Notices Open List Tenders Auctions Awards Recruitment Notices Complaint Policy (101.71 KB) Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) E-Magzine / E-Journal Open List Rajbhasha Rashmi Quarterly Report (140.12 KB) Day's Sales Quotes Export Sitemap Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Disclaimer Help Accessibility Statement Website designed and developed by: Barrierbreak Technologies | © 2011 The Cotton Corporation of India Ltd.
