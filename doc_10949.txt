Your shopping bag is empty. Go to the shop Sujay Irrigations Home Sujay Irrigations Bangalore based manufacturer of  drip and irrigation equipment Jayant. M. Jain Sujay Irrigations Pvt Ltd was established in 1996. The company is headquartered in Bangalore. It manufactures drip and sprinkler irrigation equipment and engineering plastic injection molded components. The company makes custom made drip irrigation system (DIS) based on customer requirement. Mr. Jain explains, “The design of DIS depends on the crop, crop geometry, soil type, water source, water quality and quantity, land topography, and climatic conditions, besides other factors. We do an initial survey of the farmers’ field to collect all the above data. Then we design the DIS by selecting suitable equipment for that particular field. It is all about hydraulic principles.” He adds, “Without this design, we will not be able to achieve the main goal of DIS i.e., uniform distribution of water throughout the field. This ensures that each plant gets its share of water and nutrients every day which helps it grow faster, and give maximum and uniform yield.” [hidepost] Quality Assurance Sujay manufactures lateral pipes, drippers and emitting pipes (driplines) with ISI mark and as per Indian standards. The product range also includes drip fittings, misters, microsprinklers, and other outsourced products including all types of filters, fertigation equipment, landscape products, and irrigation automation. “We use only 100% virgin raw material in all our products ensuring long life in the field. We have an in-house lab facility to test all our products before it is passed for dispatch. Any customer who is interested in knowing more about the testing is welcome to see themselves our testing. We also ensure availability of important spares with our dealers for providing after sales service to customers,” adds Mr. Jain. Financial Assistance for Small Farmers Regarding affordability for small farmers, Mr. Jain says, “The government provides financial assistance in form of subsidy at a rate of 50% plus to any farmer who adopts micro irrigation system. Central government provides 40% of the system cost and the balance 10% plus is given by the state governments. In leading states, the state governments announced higher state shares like Karnataka provides 75% (40% centre and 35% state), and Tamil Nadu 100% (40% centre and 60% state). As long as the amount sanctioned is released, there will be no problem. Companies do invest to some extent and provide credits to customers in anticipation of subsidies, but again this adds to the cost of the system further.” Mr. Jain is a mechanical engineering and joined his family business, Sujay in 2000.  He also did plastics specialization, a 1-year part time diploma course (DIPI) from the Indian Plastics Institute, Bangalore chapter. Speaking about their future plans, Mr. Jain says, “We started our second unit to increase the production capacity of irrigation equipment in 2003. In 2010, we started our plant in Mysore road, Bangalore to manufacture driplines. In the coming years we plan to set up flat dripper driplines that is getting popular.” Our Correspondent For more information, contact : Mr. Jayant. M.
