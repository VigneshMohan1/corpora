Krishnamurthy Indian Society for Certification of Organic Products (ISCOP) was started as a society under the Tamil Nadu Society’s registration Act in January 6, 2003. Prof. Dr. K.K. Krishnamurthy is the president of the society. Prof. Dr. K.K. Krishnamurthy is an M.Sc in Agriculture, Ph D in Soil Science and MBA from USA. He is a soil scientist. Dr. Krishnamurthy says that “organic agriculture is not new to us. India has been a home for organic agriculture. In 1960s and 1970s, when green revolution started, we started using heavy dose of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. resulting in pollution in our soil, air, water and other resources. Now the soil fertility is going down. So, organic agriculture is renaissance for us, new to us. Now everybody feels the need to go organic. Unless and until we go organic, our soil cannot be healthy. If soil is healthy, crops can be healthy. If the crop is healthy then human beings as well as cattle will be healthy. Right now awareness is less about organic food in our country, whereas in Western countries awareness is very high. There people prefer to purchase organic food at 10 or 20 percent higher price. “Recently we certified a product from Canada. In Edmonton they have made a product after 12 years of research. This is known as clear agriculture. That product is excellent and is making miracles now. Apply that product to the soil 2-3 times, and to the crop 2-3 times, it will give the same result as very heavy organic fertilizer like compost, vermicompost, etc. It is manufactured in Edmonton and imported here. In few months time it will be available here in India. In Canada it is called Best Environment Technologies Inc., Edmonton, Canada. Now it is being imported by a Coimbatore based company called MAK Ltd.’’ adds Krishnamurthy. “We are members of International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), Germany. I have a very good relationship with them. We are also members of International Competent Center for Organic Agriculture (ICOA) in Bangalore. We are also connected with many other universities and institutions too,’’ adds Krishnamurthy.
