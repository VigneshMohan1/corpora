Accordingly, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, 'National Food Security Mission' (NFSM), has been launched from 2007-08 to operationalise the above mentioned resolution. The National Food Security Mission will have three components (i) National Food Security Mission - Rice (NFSM-Rice); (ii) National Food Security Mission – Wheat (NFSM-Wheat); and (iii) National Food Security Mission - Pulses (NFSM-Pulses). The Mission aims to produce additional 10, 8 and 2 million tons of Rice, Wheat and Pulses respectively, there by achieving an additional production of 20 million tons of food grains by 2011-12 so as to meet the projected consumption requirement of food grains. The Mission covers about 13 million hectares of Wheat areas, 20 million hectares of Rice area and 98% of Pulses area. Mission also aims to restoring soil fertility, creating employment opportunities, and enhancing farm level economy to restore the confidence of the farmers of the targeted districts. Mission promotes proven technology and knowledge inputs packaged to deliver end-to-end agriculture services to reach out to farmers in identified districts of states that blend technology promotion with responsive administration for timely delivery of the agricultural services to bridge the yield gaps in the selected districts. By incentivizing collaborative working, mission aims to harness the capacities of the participating institutions and meet the challenge of administering its progress in the targeted relatively backward districts. During XI Plan, NFSM was implemented in 482 districts of 19 States. NFSM-Rice was implemented in 144 districts of 16 States, NFSM-Wheat in 142 districts of 9 States and NFSM-Pulses in 468 districts of 16 States. From the year 2012-13, six NE States viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim have been included under NFSM-Rice and Hilly States viz. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand under NFSM-Rice & Wheat and J&K under NFSM-Wheat. Thus, the NFSM is being implemented in 27 States of the Country during 2012-13. NFSM-Rice is being implemented in 210 districts of 24 States, NFSM-Wheat in 166 districts of 12 and NFSM-Pulses in 468 districts of 16 States Details are at Table 1. The main objective of NFSM is to increase production of rice, wheat and pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement in sustainable manner in identified districts of the country; restoring soil fertility and productivity at individual farm level; creation of employment opportunities; and enhancing farm level economy (i.e. farm profits) to restore confidence among farmers.
