The consultation was jointly organised by NACA and the Fisheries Administration of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Food and nutritional security remains problematic in many developing countries. There are many initiatives underway which are designed to increase food supply, employment and income opportunities, most of which require considerable capital inputs (for instance cropping, livestock production and aquaculture). Often overlooked, are the opportunities to produce more food from the natural productive ecology of lakes and forests. Culture-based fisheries are one example of a relatively simple and low cost technology which can deliver nutritional and economic benefits to communities which often have few livelihood options.

The strategies to optimise benefits from CBF, however, vary in detail from country to country and across climatic regimes. The project will introduce community-based CBF in Cambodia, and seek to consolidate gains of communities that have adopted CBF in Lao PDR. Thematic Studies on Gender in aquaculture in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam Tags: Vietnam , Thailand , Lao PDR , Gender , Cambodia Aquaculture is an important component of food security. Mainstreaming gender is in aquaculture value chains is crucial to inform decision making and policy formulation. The project aims to strengthen ASEAN as an institutional platform for improving regional food security via the USAID-MARKET Project. Aquaculture for Food Security, Poverty Alleviation and Nutrition Tags: Livelihoods Update: The Final Technical Report is now available! The AFSPAN Project is a three-year initiative to improve our understanding of the role of aquaculture in food security, poverty alleviation and human nutrition. The project is developing new methodologies to quantify the impact of aquaculture in developing nations and low income food deficit countries. It will enable the efficient planning, coordination and implementation of research and development programmes supporting the sustainable expansion of aquaculture, and increasing its impact on food security, livelihoods and poverty alleviation for poor people.
