He was initially into grape cultivation which was not a well-paying business for him hence he switched from horticulture to poultry business. His first move towards poultry farming was with only 100 broiler birds in 1997. Along with maintaining the poultry farm he also took up job with a company in poultry division to understand the operations more closely. “I started expanding slowly and in year 2000 the farm capacity increased to 10,000 birds. Then after I consistently kept adding birds but in small number and as of date the farm capacity has reached to 51,000,” he says. Mr. Deepak Bhor manages the business now along with his elder brother Mr. Gorakh Murlidhar Bhor. Farm is located at outskirts of Nashik city, Maharashtra. Bohr brothers are into poultry contract farming. They are responsible for raising zero day old chicks till it turns 30-45 days old. The infant chicks weigh only 40 gms and when these are sent back to the provider company the weight of birds increase to approximately 2-2.5 kg. Being a chicken contract farmer, Bhor brothers own poultry farm where they take day-to-day care and are in charge of steady growth and wellbeing of the flocks whereas Godrej Tyson Food provides chicks, feed, bedding materials, technical assistance and health care as required for raising the birds. Poultry contract farming is comparatively risk free venture, “We have well-defined agreement with the company having all the details like Rs. 4-5/kg, mortality accepted, mortality penalty and so on,” says Mr. Bohr and adds, “Prices of poultry in local market are always unstable whereas contract farming is consistent. Here I have to only focus on raising chicks, more weight gain in chicks in less days is our aim as it gives better returns.” Technical assistance is provided by the company promptly. “We are located 50 kms away from the company hatchery. Within three hours after hatching we get the chicks in my farm. We are intimated about the delivery schedule well in advance enabling us to keep the farm ready after following the cleaning and disinfection procedures as it is all-in and all-out farm. Fresh rice husk is laid on the farm floor and we ensure the old rick husk from the previous slot is sold to horticulture farmers as poultry feed,” shares Mr. Bohr. In addition strict bio-security norms are followed at the farm. Key to success in poultry business is bio-security, elaborating further he says, “We get zero day old chicks in our farm. It is very tender and is highly prone to infections. First 15 days are very crucial. Adequate care in first 15 days makes chick strong to withstand the infection. Hence, we do not allow anyone inside the farm. Every day we spray disinfectant outside the farm to keep it protected from any infection. Anyone entering inside the farm needs follow the set rules of using disinfectant spray and sanitizer. The company delivery and pick vans are allowed in the premises only after the spraying disinfectant. We sterilize things as needed.” Weight gain in chicks varies as per season. “In summer it takes 45 days for birds to gain 2-2.5 kg while in winters same weight is gained in just 30-35 days. We update company about the chicks’ growth regularly. Based on their order they can come anytime for taking the birds back. Everything depends on the weight of chicken,” he informs. 51,000 chicks are accommodated in five farms in which the latest set-up is an automated farm. Usually one bird needs one sq. ft space. Mr. Bohr has developed five poultry farms in 2.5 acres area ensuring birds get the required space. “We need ventilation space between two farms hence we have maintained the distance of 50-60 ft between two farms. All farms are of different sizes like one farm is 350 ft* 30ft while other is slight smaller than this,” he shares. Cost of constructing the farm varies with respect to farm automation. “I have invested Rs. 22 lakhs to develop my latest farm having capacity of 10,000 birds. It is fully automated farm having automatic feeders and drinking water system,” he adds. All investments made for developing the farms are through loans from Central Bank of India. On an average to develop an automated farm cost incurred is Rs. 250-300/sq ft approximately. Mr. Bohr recommends automated farm as it is more hygienic, cost effective, heat and ventilation are carefully controlled as required for healthy growth of chicks. Explaining further he says, “The automatic feeding system has a hopper to which we add the feed. The hopper is connected to the feeder pan and the feed level is set at 100gms. When chicks eat the feed, the hopper automatically fills the feeder pan till 100 gms. So chicks always have food around. Secondly in maple line water system, there are drinking water nozzles. These nozzles have sensor, as the chick touches it, the water comes drop by drop that goes straight inside the bird’s beak. In this way water is always clean and we do not have to worry about spilling. It safeguards the chicks from infections as well.” All the five farms are managed by the entire Bohr family, he says, “We prefer to do and monitor things on our own. All our family members are involved in the business.” Contract poultry business is 50% expense and 50% profit. “Approximately annually Rs. 8-9/bird is income and after expenses Rs. 4-5/bird is the profit. We also supply good quality of poultry based fertilizer,” informs Mr. Deepak Bohr. Sharing future plan he says, “After repaying the loan we shall expand with poultry egg business. We are focused we will stay in poultry business.” Contact details- Bohr Farm Post Mungsara Taluk, Nashik District, Maharashtra – 422003 Mobile – 09923137759, 09922907759 Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Bhor Brothers – contract farming for broiler chicken Related – articles, consultants, downloads Rainbow Agro Enterprises – Contract farming Ashrams Bio Health – Contract farming Dr. B.
