The Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station  (OAES) conducts research for the purpose of developing new knowledge to address the needs of Oklahomans. OAES research focuses on agriculture, natural resources, rural economies and social issues. Approximately 37 percent of Oklahoma State University’s research efforts are  undertaken as part of the statewide Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station system. OAES research expenditures account for more than $50 million annually.  Keith Owens  Interim Associate Director  Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station     Our History The Hatch Act of 1887 established the State Experiment Station system and provided land and/or funds for each state to develop an Agricultural Experiment Station to conduct research, especially in the areas of soil minerals and plant growth. The Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station was established by the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature in 1890. The first building constructed on the Oklahoma A&M College campus was the Experiment Station Barn, which was completed in 1892, a year before construction began on ‘Old Central’ in 1893. Today, OAES stands as the research leg of the three agency group comprising the Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources , which also includes teaching ( the College ) and outreach ( Cooperative Extension ).  More than 100 Ph.D.-level faculty members are funded at least partially by the OAES to conduct research in areas ranging from cattle and wheat production to cell wall biology and mechanisms that affect conversion of plant materials to biofuels. Research labs are located in Agricultural Hall, Noble Research Center, Food & Agricultural Products and Animal Science buildings on campus. Additionally, the OAES operates field, greenhouse and lab facilities at 18 research stations and/or centers located throughout the state.   Document Actions Send this Print this Oklahoma State University  Stillwater, OK 74078 | 405.744.5000 DASNR News Woodland Owner Workshop scheduled in Idabel May 29, 2015 Tips for summer grilling safety May 27, 2015 Drought-tolerant garden to open at the Oklahoma City Zoo May 26, 2015 Important tips for homeowners to help avoid water damage May 20, 2015 OSU professor named ASHS Fellow May 19, 2015 More…   Stillwater Tulsa Oklahoma City Center for Health Sciences Division of Agriculture Institute of Technology Veterinary Medicine Suggestion Box Accessibilty Safety Legal and Trademarks Webmaster © 2015 - Oklahoma State University | All rights reserved
