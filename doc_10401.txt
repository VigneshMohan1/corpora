Appointing new distributors Infinite Solar was registered in November 2012. Mr. Manan Mody and Mr. Krunal Prajapati are the founders. It is a Mumbai based company supplying solar power products. The company clocked an annual turnover of Rs. 1.5 crores last year. The product portfolio consists of solar lanterns and solar street lights having four and two variants respectively. All the products are assembled. “Quality check is maintained at all the stages,” shares Mr. Mody. Most of the products are made using lithium ion batteries as they have long life. Acid batteries are also used for which the company provides the guarantee. Design and functionality are the key features of these solar based products. These can be used as a table lamp, ceiling lamp, or torch – all in one piece. “We have created new type of street lights which have inbuilt batteries. This eliminates chances of theft of batteries and is easy to install,” he adds. Annually 15000 solar lanterns and 800 solar street lights are assembled. The response received from customers for the products is encouraging. In all there are 80 distributors appointed in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat who are responsible for sales. “We have also tied up with some NGOs to supply our products to other untapped markets. We have achieved a sizable business in solar street lights,” shares Mr. Mody. The company plans to appoint more distributors in coming months. Maximum sales, minimum returns, and timely payments are the expectations from the distributors. People interested to take up company’s distributorship need to make the capital investment of Rs. 75,000/- for first time billing and subsequent billing should be made at least for Rs. 30,000/-. Appointing distributors and continuing long term relations with them are challenging tasks, feels Mr. Mody. Speaking on after sales service he informs, “We return the serviced products in 2 to 4 days after the receipt of damaged products.” All the distributors are given a day to return the products. Export of lanterns to African and mostly South Asian countries is on cards. Advertisements in print and online media are the sources to identify prospective business sales partners in International market.  The company plans to reach large institutional clients and NGOs to boost the sale. Rest it shall continue to focus on product assembling and after sales services. Mr. Manan Mody is a management graduate from Jaihind College, Mumbai University. After serving for an investment bank as a financial analyst for 20 years he later decided to embrace entrepreneurship. He established Infinite Solar along with his partner Mr. Krunal Prajapati. Mr. Prajapati holds B.Tech (Civil) from VJTI, Mumbai. He worked for a construction company for a few years before getting into solar product assembling business.
