Go to the shop Retail marketing support to farmers Home Retail marketing support to farmers Admark Ventures located at Mumbai is creating a whole new business in agriculture retailing From advertising and marketing consultancy to agriculture retail    wasn’t smooth sailing for Mr.Vivek Samudre but he kept the greater objective of helping farmers in mind without losing focus. Mr. Samudre founded Admark Ventures in 2009 in Mumbai. The company operates predominantly in Maharashtra. Admark is engaged in the following activities: • Helping farmers to cultivate according to a given schedule which is driven by demand in the market • Creating a direct retail market for the farmers • Encouraging the farmers to get into food processing • Redirecting farmers kins who have taken up non-agriculture jobs back to agriculture – at least on a part-time basis Creating Market Mr. Samudre maintains that he does not enter into contract farming. “The farmers cultivate according to our schedule. We provide the seeds, fertilizer, and the farming techniques and sell what they produce in the market for them. We are trying to create a market for the farmers so that they know exactly what to grow and how they can make money,” he maintains Creating Awareness Mr. Samudre creates awareness about the company through farmers’ network. “We spend time with the farmers and find out their needs, and connect with them socially. If they have to sell their produce, we make arrangement for them to be sold. Just like I have a network of farmers, I also have a network of buyers,” he says. He further adds, “I am doing this not to make money. I am happy even if my expenses are met but the consumer should be able to buy a good product at a good price so that the farmer is able to make more profits.” He also offers free service if farmers need help. Fields to Tables A strong advocate of food processing, Mr. Samudre says, “Let us take the example of tomatoes, which have very low shelf life. Lot of produce is wasted and the farmers do not get a good price. This happens because they cannot afford cold storage facility. But if we teach them how to make finished products like dried tomatoes and ketchup, they can get better price.” Mr. Samudre disagrees that food processing requires major investment. “All chips and snacks items that multinationals manufacture started from somebody’s house and later become a commercial product. I believe that there should be farmers willing to take it back to the grassroots level so that the investment required will be less. For example they can make ginger garlic paste, and even soya sauce. Some farmers have done their own R & D, and have started making idly out of jowar and also chakli.” Scheduled Benefits Speaking about the benefits that Admark offers, Mr. Samudre says, “The farmer are less worried as they don’t have to sell the produce in the market. Since we are creating the retail market we do the market research and schedule the cultivation accordingly. We give them the guarantee that we will buy from them.” Mr. Samudre is from science educational background.
