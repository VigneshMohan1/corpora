Contents 1 Life and career 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Life and career [ edit ] Heng Samrin was born in Kampong Cham Province , Cambodia, in 1934. He became a member of the Khmer Rouge communist movement led by Pol Pot , and he became a political commissar and army division commander when the Khmer Rouge took over the government in 1975. In 1978, he defected from the Khmer Rouge, which was backed by China , and fled to Vietnam . There he became one of the founding members of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation (FUNSK). Later that year, Heng returned to Cambodia, leading a rebellion which was backed by Vietnam and the Soviet Union . After a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Vietnamese occupation authorities established the People's Republic of Kampuchea , installing Heng and other pro-Vietnamese Communist politicians as leaders of the new government. [ 1 ] He became chairman of the People's Revolutionary Council of the PRK in 1979. In 1981 he became chairman of the Council of State and secretary-general of the People's Revolutionary Party. Though at first he was the effective leader of the government, he quickly lost much of his power when the more moderate Hun Sen became Prime Minister in 1985. As Vietnamese influence declined, Heng began losing his posts, including the post of secretary-general in 1991 and chairman of the council of state in 1992. When King Norodom Sihanouk was restored in 1993, Heng was given the honorary title of Sâmdech, senior advisor of the King, and was made honorary chairman of Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party . He was vice chairman of the National Assembly of Cambodia (1998–2006). Since 2006, he acts as Chairman of the Solidarity Front for Development of the Cambodian Motherland . Today, Heng Samrin is a much loved and respected figure among the members of the Cambodian People's Party, even though his duties are often largely ceremonial. [ 2 ] The Cambodian People's Party recently released a book about him called A Man of the People , [ 3 ] dedicated to him as a hero. [ 4 ] His full title is Samdach Akeak Moha Ponhea Chakrei Heng Samrin, Protean Radhsaphea ney Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea .
