Any balance that is unpaid after the 15th will be assessed a finance charge of 1.5% or an annual percentage rate of 19.56% when computed from the billing date. If your bursar account becomes past due, finance charges are added, enrollment for future semesters is not allowed, and transcripts and diplomas are not released until the past due balance is paid in full.
