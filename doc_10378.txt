Go to the shop Bhustalimath BM – Groundwater Investigation Services Home Bhustalimath BM – Groundwater Investigation Services Air and water are the nature’s invaluable free gifts to life on earth. While the air is evenly distributed in atmosphere, water is not so distributed. It is available through rain (not under the command of living beings) and through the groundwater streams unseen. Geoscience is equipped to trace it and divine methods give a hint of these unseen underground streams of water. The better use of water can transform agriculture, economy, industry and so on. I am a passionate professional in finding water with a proven success. My methods of groundwater investigation are Scientific and Divine, in all eleven methods. Distribution of water: 70% seas, 30% land. Of 30% on land, 68% in icecaps,2% rivers and lakes, 30% underground.(Unseen by the people) Nature’s clues of groundwater: (1) The annual rain-fall (2)Nearby water-bodies (3) Density of trees (4) Catchment area (5) Aquifer characteristics. Methods of Groundwater investigation: (1) Coconut (2) Y notch/Forked stick (3) Copper wand ( V shaped/ U shaped)/Coin (4) Pendulam/Bob/Chain/Necklace/Wrist watch/ Water-ball/Mud-ball (5) L rods (6) Geomagnetic flux (7) Infrasonics (8) Biogeology (9) Topography/Geomorphology (10) Vertical Electrical Sounding/Resistivity/conductivity method (VER/VES). Testing by more or all methods( which all I practise) is advisable to ensure 100% accracy, as drilling/ digging costs are high now and risk factors are more. Risk factors in drilling: (1) Use of slightly bent rods,(2) Driller’s leg/s jerking in the course of drilling (3) Boulders/ Silt/ mud or sand collapse before the targeted water is reached (4) An outcrop in the stream (5) Drill-head skidding (diversion due to mettalic rock-edging) (6) Dry-gaps below the stream. (7) A drilling near a well/ borewell (air-gap or water-leakage.) (8) Wear and tear of drilling master and rods. All the above risks can be avoided/solved with right advice.((Please write to bmbmath@gmail.com) Please call/SMS/email your details (Name, Contact number, address with landmark and mail id) for enquiries/appointments Contact: Bhustalimath B M ( Basavaraj) Tel : 91 9538909542 / 080-39516460 Email : bmbmath@gmail.com or bmbmath@yahoo.com Address: 95, TF-1, Adishree Appt, Near Krishna Temple, Doddabommasandra, Vidyaranyapura, Bangalore-560097 (Doddabommasandra Arch, Bharat Electronics).     Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Bhustalimath BM – Groundwater Investigation Services Related – articles, consultants, downloads Shripad Consultancy – Geological Investigation of Water You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
