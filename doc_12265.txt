Welcome To CSA, University of Agriculture & Technology The Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture & Technology, Kanpur is recognized today as the premier institution of agricultural research and education in India. It dates back to 1893 when a small school was started to impart training to revenue officers which rose step by step to full-fledged Government Agriculture College (1906), U.P. Institute of Agricultural Sciences (1969) and finally to C.S. Azad University of Agriculture & Technology in 1975. The University was created with the merger of its two constituent colleges, the erstwhile Government Agriculture College, Kanpur and U.P. College of Veterinary Science & Animal Husbandry, Mathura.
