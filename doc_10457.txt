Plans to switch to organic farming in future and develop pomegranate orchard Mr. Pranay Mehta and his brother-in-law established Sirohi Farms in Mandwada in July 2013. The total area of the farm is 28 acres. Cumin, rye and castor are the major plants of the farm. Tomatoes, onions, radishes, okra, fenugreek and spinach are also grown in the farm. Urea and DAP were used to cultivate the farm’s produce since the land was barren in the beginning. He plans to stop using the chemicals he currently uses on cumin when the crop is harvested. His farm has not faced any issues with pests yet. “Buying pest free seeds saves the trouble of spraying pesticides,” Mr. Mehta adds. Castor planted in the farm has already started to yield. They will be sold in the local market. Hairy variety of cumin was planted in October last year and is expected to yield next month. It will be sold at Unjha in Gujarat. Vegetables were grown for trial basis, and hence are supplied to friends and relatives. Mr. Mehta hopes to convert his farm into a pomegranate orchard in the future. Mr. Mehta holds various degrees such as B.Com, L.L.B and CA. He got into agriculture after his retirement.
