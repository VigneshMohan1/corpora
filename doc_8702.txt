The increasing trend of agricultural production has brought, in its wake, new challenges in terms of finding market for the marketed surplus. There is also a need to respond to the challenges and opportunities, that the global markets offer in the liberalised trade regime. To benefit the farming community from the new global market access opportunities, the internal agricultural marketing system in the country needs to be integrated and strengthened. Government of India is striving to prepare the Indian agricultural markets and marketing environment so as to provide maximum benefit to the producers and in turn, compete with the global markets. Agriculture and agricultural marketing need to be re-oriented to respond to the market needs and consumer preferences. Agricultural marketing reforms and creation of marketing infrastructure has been initiated to achieve the above purpose.     Marketing Reforms Background Constraints of present Markets Need for reforms Implementation  Infrastructure Requirement Marketing Research & Information Network   Contact Points State Marketing Boards NABARD Regional Offices  State Nodal Officers   Detail Information on Market Yards Project Outlay for Fruit Market Yard Repayment Schedule for Fruit Market Yard Project Techno-Financial Parameters Adopted for Working aout the Economics of a Fruit Market Yard Income and Expenditure for Vegetable Market Yard Project Outlay for Vegetable Market Yard Repayment Schedule for Vegetable Market Yard Project
