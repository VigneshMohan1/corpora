Established in 1976 at Pune, Maharashtra, Pansare Nursery has come a long way due to efforts and vision of Mr. D. Y. Pansare. His son, Mr. Bala Saheb Pansare, Managing Director says, “Initially my father worked on others’ field but always dreamed of good life. Working in the fields he knew the nature of plants well. He observed it was difficult to set up fruit orchards hence he decided to start the nursery to develop plants, giving easy access to good and healthy saplings for people interested in farming.” Nursery was started with the capital investment of only Rs. 5000/- which today has grown and expanded to total capital of Rs 3.5 Crores. The plants are developed using modern technology where fully computerized system is used for fertigation and irrigating the plants. “Computerized system has very high level accuracy. It can work in day and night without any human support. It saves electricity, water and time. We have polyhouses to maintain our plants. We use different techniques like air layering, winnear graft, approach graft, tone graft, etc.,” adds Mr. B.Pansare, “We ensure to use best mother plants to produce the plants. Especially in fruit plants we take the mother plant only from carefully identified source. We have skilled gardener for grafting the young saplings.” Talking about the unique features of the saplings he says, “Our plants have more immunity to resist the disease and pest attack. It starts yielding soon.” Mr. Pansare constantly works on new varieties of plants. He shares, “We developed dragon fruit saplings after intense trials taking in consideration all aspects (viability, durability, market conditions etc). It took us 2 years to develop the perfect sapling.
