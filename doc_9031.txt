We were on the lookout to start a goat farm along with a Country Chicken farm, we are troubled with a few questions which are listed below (1) how profitable is Goat farming (2) What amount of profit (after all expenses) can we derieve from a goat (3) How long will it take for a goat to be marketed (4) How to market the same (5) what is the price of a kid (baby goat) and what is the price at which it can be sold Sorry to trouble you with many questions - we are just amateurs in this field and are trying to collect maximum information before we start the farm Once again thaks a lot for your help on this Kind Regards Riju Reply With Quote March 22nd, 2012 #3 smy82482 Join Date Mar 2012 Posts 2,324 1.Presently goat farm is very profitable in any part of our country,if its managed well. 2.U can get double your amount of your investment,at the end of the year excluding expenditures. 3.It takes atleast 6 months for a goat to be marketed,also on the type of breed. 4.For marketing u should have contacts in u r local area market,coz small goat farms are dependent on local markets.Dont sell the goats to the agents,they will take away lot of profit which u would receive.Marketing is not a problem at all.Once u have started goat farm u will automatically receives the order,as it has a high demanad in any part of country. 5.Price of kid cant be calculated properly.As the main marketing products are does(female goat) and bucks(male goats).So to yield maximum profit u have to sell does and bucks of alteast 6months old.Price also depends on your area.

Following are the points to cover. *first of all give each unit a separate name like A,B,C or A1,A2,A3 etc and keep each stalls record separately. *Tag each an every goat,according to insurance.So this should be mention in your software *vaccination record of each unit(A,B,C) *disease record from which goats have suffered *pregnant goats record( number of goats which are pregnant in each unit) *kids record(note the entry of kids after birth given by each goat) *deworming *fodder intake of each unit *cleaning period of stall *death of kids and goats of each unit *number of kids taken out of stall for sell from each unit *price entry of kids sold *price entry of goats purchased *short summary at top of homepage showing total number of kids,goats of all units *type of breed *salary paid to workers and many more points,that will suggest u the software developer. After developing software,dont forget to have a security of SSL so that it shouldnt be hacked by any one. For software development u can contact infosys,abhishek infotech,acresscent,worldwide infosoft,hazel infotech,akon services etc from pune.And they will provide u at cheaper rates,coz there is a lot of competition among them to sell there softwares.

Some people that are in goat farming business do not provide shelters for their goats. They let them find shelter in cedar thickets, under rock ledges or any other suitable shelter which the goats come across. But your goats will do better for your goat farming and require less feed if they have shelter from rain, wind, and cold in winter. Making your goat a proper house means that it should alter or modify the environment for the benefit of your goat and also protect them from predation and theft which will always be beneficial for your goat farming business. Your goat house should buffer your goats from climate extremes to reduce stress allowing optimal performance in terms of growth, health and reproduction. It’s enough if the goats are provided with a: • dry, • comfortable, • safe and secure place, • free from worms, • affording protection from excessive heat and cold • adequate space for movement • Separate compartments for kids and pregnant mothers • inclement weather. It is worthwhile to design a cheap house for goats which may result in increased milk and meat production for your goat farming business.
