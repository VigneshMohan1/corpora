Public-private alliances help to boost farmers’ capacities to tackle new pests and diseases in cassava.</p> <p><img alt="" height="455" src="/sites/all/modules/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/images/Mealybug%20DVD%20box%20cover%20for%20print%281%29.jpg" width="640" /></p> <p>The <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271">Managing mealybugs in cassava</a> video and related audio files are downloadable from the Access Agriculture website in <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271">English</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/fr">French</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/id">Bahasa Indonesia</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/my">Burmese</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/khm">Khmer</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/lo">Lao</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/th">Thai</a> - <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/1271/vi">Vietnamese</a>.</p> <p>Currently, the video is distributed in the main cassava-growing regions through various media. In some countries, videos are broadcast on national television, and national extension offices are diffusing video material through their established channels. Many factories are mobilizing their networks of traders and technical personnel to project the video to cassava growers.</p> <p>An earlier study in Uganda showed that rice millers were the most active in organising video shows for farmers (see: <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/492" target="_blank">Millers distribute and show videos</a>). After all, by providing an extra service to farmers they will attract more business.</p> <p>For more information on the cassava mealybug extension campaign, contact Le Ngoc Lan (<a href="mailto:l.le@cgiar.org" target="_blank">l.le@cgiar.org</a>) or Kris Wyckhuys (<a href="mailto:k.wyckhuys@cgiar.org">k.wyckhuys@cgiar.org</a>) – International Center for Tropical Agriculture, CIAT, Hanoi (Vietnam)</p> </div></div></div> 10,000 more DVDs <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>“The series of videos on managing striga and improving soil fertility has been so popular that we already finished our stock of 20,000 DVDs for Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger,” says Dr Eva Weltzien from ICRISAT, Bamako.</p> <p><img alt="" src="/sites/all/modules/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/images/Handing%20over%20Striga%202%20cc.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px; height: 225px;" /><img alt="" src="/sites/all/modules/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/images/photo%20impact%20study%207.jpg" style="width: 301px; height: 225px;" /></p> <p>Hundreds of farmer organisations, cooperatives, radio stations, development partners, as well as individual farmers have over the past two years received copies of the DVD, baptised under the name “Fighting Striga”.</p> <p>A follow up study in Mali showed that most of the people who received the DVDS were able to find a way to watch them. For example the school or a neighbour had a DVD player and TV set, a laptop, or a portable DVD player with built-in screen for watching entertainment videos. </p> <p>Most of the villagers watched the videos on their own, without an extensionist to answer questions.</p> <p>These and other studies on the use and impact of videos are summarised as one-page summary sheets available on the Access Agriculture website under <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.org/node/492">Impact studies</a>.</p> <p>Based on the continued demand, ICRISAT decided to order 10,000 more DVDs.</p> <p>“It is a small investment that creates great impacts,” says ICRISAT’s regional director for West and Central Africa, Dr. Tabo Ramadjita.</p> </div></div></div> Young Innovators Award! <div class="field field-name-field-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.accessagriculture.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Innovators-awards-registration-poster%20%28Final%20Draft%29.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><strong>Young Innovators Award!</strong><br />  <br /> Young Individuals and groups are invited to submit their ideas, innovations and technologies for consideration<br />  <br /><strong>Submissions are welcome under the following four categories:</strong></p> <ol><li> Innovations and technologies benefiting women smallholder farmers</li> <li> Innovations and technologies benefiting People With Disabilities (PWDs)  who     are engaging in smallholder farming</li> <li> Communication technologies  which  promote the dissemination of agricultural innovations          </li> <li> Agricultural innovations and technologies developed within learning and research institutions.</li> </ol><p> <br /> Consideration will be given to submissions which are relevant to the award categories and they are: <br /> •           Enhance food security           <br /> •           Improve nutritional value<br /> •           Increase productivity and yield<br /> •           Add value and increase income potential<br /> •           Reduce labour and time intensity<br /> •           Respond to climate-related challenges<br /> •           Use locally available  inputs<br /> •           Are affordable and socially sustainable<br /> •           Reduce postharvest loss<br />  <br /> Eligible Countries: Burundi, Djibouti,<br /> D.R. of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,<br /> Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia,<br /> South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan,<br /> Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.<br />  </p> </div></div></div> Egerton University visits Access Agriculture <div class="field field-name-field-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.accessagriculture.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/IMG_2806.JPG" width="480" height="320" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><strong>Egerton University  visits Access Agriculture</strong><br /> On 27th August, 2014, Access Agriculture hosted 17 post-graduate students and 3 lecturers from Egerton University  who were on familiarization tour of Access Agriculture at their Nairobi office.<br /> The delegation learnt first-hand how to use the Access Agriculture website to download videos for use as teaching material for secondary school students.   At the end of a two-hour visit, the group offered to arrange some DVD shows for their students, farmers and CBOs to showcase the innovations in the Access Agriculture library.</p> </div></div></div> Networking with local organisations <div class="field field-name-field-picture field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.accessagriculture.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/languages_0.jpg" width="480" height="282" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Based upon demand Access Agriculture translates any video available on its website into any language.

A three year project is showing training videos to farmers in North Rift Valley. Among the videos which have been catching farmer's attention are the series on Sustainable Land Management. At the launch event the programme on Conservation Agriculture <a href="http://www.accessagriculture.orgnode/913/en">http://www.accessagriculture.orgnode/913/en</a> fostered a lot of interest. One of the farmers said, <em>"I wish to urge everyone in our village to atend this video shows next time they come to our village. For us today we have gone to Zambia and saw what farmers are doing there. What we have learned is that we do not have to burn the maize stalks after harvesting as we have always done here.”</em></p> <p>Among the conversation points for the farmers were:</p> <p>-    New farming techniques<br /> -    No need to burn maize stalks after harvesting as it helps in enhancing soil fertility<br /> -    Importance of intercropping</p> <p>Technoserve is now exploring the Access Agriculture website to select other suitable videos to help farmers in their target counties. </p> <p>The Mobile Training Unit has two giant LCD screens, a speaker system, awnings and chairs for up to 100 people.</p> <p> </p> </div></div></div>
