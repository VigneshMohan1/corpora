Organic Farming Scheme in Department of Horticulture Many corporate houses require a regular supply of organic foods and all the polyclinics in the major cities demand toxin free fruits and vegetables for inmates. The retailers of metropolitan cities and exporters of vegetable to the Middle East / Far East require small quantities of organic produce on a continuous basis throughout the year. Correspondingly substantial area in Erode, Thirunelvi, Sivagangai, Coimbatore and Madurai districts have been converted into organic horticultural production systems. APEDA has accredited Spices Board and OASIS, an NGO to certify the organic farms. Importing regions such as the EU are insisting on adherence to Sanitary and Phyto Sanitary standards (SPS) and Traceability norms on the import of food products. The WTO also has developed norms for Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in line with Europe Gap to ensure food safety. In this context, it is imperative to promote organic farming in places like Nilgiris, Sathyamangalam, Sivagangai, Tirunelveli, Theni etc., so as to enable the farmers to get certified by agencies like INDOCERT, SKAL, and IFOAM. Hence, there is a proposal to provide 1400 ha of organic gardens, 42 vermicompost units and Organic certification (cluster of 50 Ha) during 2005-06. The organic producers are to be trained on GAP, SPS and traceability issues. Currently, there is no institutional mechanism to link the production base with the retail sector. District level collection centers and retail sales centers at Urban areas are proposed to be established under Tamil Nadu Horticultural Produces Co-operative Enterprises, primarily a farmers co-operative, so that a steady flow of organic produce is ensured between the producers and consumers. This model is proposed to be implemented in two production centers during 2005–06 and scaled up to all major horticultural clusters in the next couple of years. The total financial assistance sought in 2005-06 for all initiatives under Organic farming (all components) is Rs 157.6 Lakhs.
