A.J. and Koryn both attended the AOF at Hamilton Southeastern High School in Indiana and their father, Randy, has been an advisory board member for almost eight years.  “The academy has been instrumental in [Koryn and A.J.’s] success as they enter college and seek internship opportunities in college,” said Randy DelPrince. A.J. will graduate from the Kelly School of Business at Indiana University in the Spring of 2015 with a double major in Finance and Entrepreneurship and a minor in Healthcare Administration. Koryn, a freshman at the University of Colorado – Boulder, is thinking about pursuing marketing and is in a highly selective scholars program that provides work-based learning opportunities for its members. Both A.J. and Koryn had internships in high school that helped give them a competitive edge over their peers.  A.J. interned at First Advantage helping new hires fill out their tax forms. “It was definitely a good stepping stone,” A.J. said, “it put me in a professional environment early, which was a big deal and a good resume builder.” His high school internship helped him land two more internships in college – one with Royal United Mortgage and another with 3M. After his internship, 3M offered A.J. a full-time job in the construction and home improvement division! A.J. attributes much of his success to his academy, “The AOF gives you a leg up in terms of competition between other students, so I’ve always had an advantage over other kids in college because I’ve been a part of an Academy of Finance.”  For Koryn, it was helpful to be introduced to business classes in high school so that she could excel in her college-level classes. Her mother, Sherrie DelPrince, noted that being exposed to different types and aspects of business made her a lot more comfortable with the coursework her first semester. As part of the academy’s work-based learning program, Koryn had the opportunity to go on job shadows and visit “thinkorswim” in Chicago. A.J. & Koryn’s rewarding experience in their academy is largely due to the support the advisory board and other community leaders offered. Randy has been on the advisory board since 2007, helping secure job shadows, mentorships, internships, and funds for the academy. Randy and Sherrie have offered internships to academy students from developing an enterprise content management system for a financial services company to marketing and accounting for their small business. Thanks to their commitment to the academy and their community, the AOF has a number of companies that are willing to host interns year after year. “Companies that bring on interns are helping their community and these students, but it also brings reward to the company,” said Randy.    ShareThis Copyright © 2012 National Academy Foundation.
