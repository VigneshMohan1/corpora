The aerial part is being thrown or dumped in the field by the growers. Only root and basal thick stem are harvested for medicinal use. Interested growers can get the coleus shoots from the fields and plant in your field for nursery use. Because of water shortage several growers unable to maintain nursery of coleus. Those who are having sufficient watering facility from bore well or any other water source can maintain a coleus nursery in 10 cents - 1 acre. You can take Coleus cutting from the nursery in order to plant in the main field for the forth coming season (june - Aug). You can also sell coleus cutting to the growers. About 20000 shoots are required to plant in one acre. Coleus propagation(Multiplication) is through stem cuttings only. No seeds available for it. Try to raise Coleus nursey.

The crop will be affected by nematodes, and fungus. Control measure should be taken once in fifteen days after the shoot established well.

My Land is situated about 70 kms from UP-Uttaranchal border. This Land is situated in Indo-Gangetic plains and is composed of fertile alluvial soil. Temperatures range from a low of six degrees to a high of 45 degrees. All Crops ranging from sugercane, rice, wheat, mentha are cultivated, mango and guava orchards are plentiful.
