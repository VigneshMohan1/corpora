After its inauguration by the Hon’ble President of India on July 16, 2013 and since its inception nearly 50 crore messages or more than 180 crore SMSs have been sent to farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country. These messages are specific to farmers’ specific needs & relevance at a particular point of time and these generate heavy inflow of calls in the Kisan Call Centres where people call up to get supplementary information. A comprehensive feedback mechanism in the form of IVRS, email and Pull SMS has also been implemented. This is helping in continuous evolution of the portal in terms of addition of new features and improving the quality of advisories being sent. The portal has received accolades from all its users. Few of testimonials are: “... good price for farmers’ produce is a key feature of the market economy, as is mitigating risks. The SMS portal seeks to fulfil this..." “We r very much thankful for giving the best sms portal for the welfare of the farming community.” Kisan Call Center Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
