A good knowledge of forest type is essential for the successful practice of silviculture and forest management. Forest vegetation is divided into five major groups according to temperature zones. Each major group is divided into type groups on the availability of moisture exhibited in the physiognomic variation like evergreen, deciduous, thorny features etc. The type groups are ultimately distinguished into climatic, edaphic seral and degradation types.
