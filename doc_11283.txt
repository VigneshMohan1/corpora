Works with farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan Vantage Organic Foods was established on 17th July 2008 with registered office at Jaipur. The oilseed processing unit is at Indore and farmer base at Guna (MP) and Barmer (Raj). The founders of the company are Mr. Vipul Gupta, his Mother and Late Smt. Shashi Gupta. The company is a global supplier of certified organic and conventional ingredients. “I felt that organic food will be the future,” shares Mr Gupta, Director which is why he chose to deal in organic products. The company makes arrangements with farmers wherein the farmers follow the organic practices as told by the company’s team. The company purchases from the farmers at rates based on the current market prices at the time of purchase. However, it’s not mandatory for the farmers to sell the products to the company. In MP the company is working with approx. 10,000 farmers for organic cultivation of soybean and in Rajasthan with more than 12,000 farmers for organic cultivation of cumin, psyllium, castor, beans and other crops. The benefits of associating with the company include training on better farming practices, assured market, fast payment and no mediators. “We continuously discuss the future products and market with our customers,” he shares which enables the company to cater to the requirements of the customers while also helps farmers for better earnings. The company identifies the crop and area after which they approach the farmers and enlighten them about the advantages and the disadvantages of organic farming. “We register the interested farmers and train them to adopt the organic and better farming practices,” he shares. The company also help farmers get organic certification. The company chiefly works on oilseeds like soybean, rapeseeds, sunflower seeds etc. At the time of crop planning the company suggests the requirements to the farmers based on climatic pattern of the region. “But the final decision is of the farmer what to grow,” clarifies Mr Gupta, “We are mainly working on soybeans and have been processing for the same. Soybean is a good crop and there is a good demand of the same.” The company owns a soybean processing unit located at Indore where they process soybean for soymeal and soy oil. “At present the domestic market is not developed to have a sustainable business model,” says Mr Gupta. As such the company deals only in overseas supplies to countries like USA, Canada and EU. To create awareness the company takes part in international trade fairs. While handling for overseas supplies the company monitors every step from farmers training, cultivation, and integrity of produce, produces quality, processing, packing and finishing product as per customer requirements. When asked how the company connects with farmers Mr. Gupta replies, “It is a regular exercise wherein our team interacts with the farmers on daily basis, understands their practices and solves their problems.” As for Govt. support in organic farming Mr Gupta says, “Govt is making efforts to promote organic farming by financing farmers (ICS operator and certification body).” “The company plans to have more and more products as organic offering for exports,” shares Mr Gupta. The company also have plans to launch products for the domestic market.
