Rebeccaâ€™s Gift About How we help News Event Contact Us Rebeccaâ€™s Gift is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing healing family vacations after the death of a child in honor and memory of Rebecca Alison Meyer, a child who loved fiercely and was fiercely loved in return. Rebecca loved to go on adventures and her favorites took place while traveling, especially when she could go on rides or win a prize. After Rebeccaâ€™s death at age six from an aggressive brain tumor, her family was thrown into a world of grief. As they started to emerge from their intensive grief, they took to the road again. With each trip, they created new memories and healed a little. Rebeccaâ€™s Gift was created to share the gift of travel and healing with other grieving families. Rebeccaâ€™s Gift is a nonprofit corporation exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
