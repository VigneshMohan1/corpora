Deadline: open throughout the year. http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/whats_new14/bdi-advt-webpage.pdf About Grants in India: As anywhere in the world, majority of the funding for research in India comes through the government. Much of the funding for life science research is channeled through the Central Government’s Department of Science and Technology-DST and the Department of Biotechnology-DBT. Both DBT as well as DST, have various extramural funding schemes. Other agencies that fund extramural grants include Department of scientific and Industrial research- DSIR, Department of Atomic Energy- DAE, Department of Ocean Development and Earth Sciences and Department of space – to name a few. Apart from these, life science sectors are also funded by Department of Agriculture through the Indian Council for Agricultural Research - ICAR and the Indian Council for Medical Research that falls under the auspices of Department of Health Research. Many of the funding bodies including DST and DBT, have autonomous research institutes/universities under their umbrella. These institutions receive their core funding through one of the agencies. Each also routes core/intramural funding towards autonomous institutions that fall under the umbrella of a particular agency. For example the IISERs are all MHRD institutions while the NISERs are DAE funded. Similarly ICAR, ICMR and CSIR fund over 20 institutions each all around India. Apart from funding research, the agencies also award small grants for Symposia and workshops. They also award travel grants for attending conferences. Here, our attempt has been to give you an overview of the way Government research funds are channeled in India. Hopefully, this will help you approach the appropriate agency for grants/funds for your research project.
