Geographically, the state is divided into two regions - Kumaon and Garhwal. Uttaranchal is a wonderful place for trekking and other adventure sports activities. People call it the "Land of Gods" due to its multitude of religious places of worship and the divine presence of the snow covered Himalayan mountain ranges. The glaciers of Uttaranchal are source of the two most sacred rivers in India - the Ganges and the Yamuna. The state is dotted with beautiful hill stations like Almora, Mussoorie, and Nainital. There are also places of worship such as Haridwar, Rishikesh (the Yoga Capital of the World), Kedarnath and Badrinath. Valley of Flowers National Park and Corbett National Park are the two famous national parks in the state and both of them house a wide variety of exquisite flora and fauna.
