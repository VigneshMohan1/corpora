It lies between 8°05' N - 13°35' N latitude and 76°15' - 80020' E longitude. Physiographically, the state can be divided into four major regions namely, Coastal Plains, Eastern Ghats, Central Plateau and Higher Elevation Mountains. The south-west monsoon feeds the plateau and the retreating north-east monsoon brings rain to the east coast. The temperature in state ranges from 2°c in the hills to 45°c in other areas. The average rainfall ranges from 925 mm to 1,170 mm. As per Census 2011, the population of the state is 72.14 million which constitutes 5.96% of the country's population. Rural population constitutes 51.55% and urban population 48.45%. The population density is 555 persons per km2. The livestock population of the state is 30.76 million (Livestock Census 2007).   Land use pattern Land Use Area in ‘000 ha Percentage Total geographical area 13,006 - Reporting area for land utilization 13,027 100.00 Forests 2,106 16.17 Not available for cultivation 2,665 20.46 Permanent pastures and other grazing lands 110 0.84 Land under misc. tree crops & groves 259 1.99 Culturable wasteland 333 2.56 Fallow lands other than current fallows 1,498 11.50 Current Fallows 1,013 7.77 Net area sown 5,043 38.71 Forest Resources The recorded forests area is 22,877 km², which constitutes 17.59 % of the geographic area of the state. Reserved Forests comprise 84.75 %, Protected forests, 9.54 % and Unclassed Forests, 5.71 %. Major forest types occurring in the State are Tropical Wet Evergreen, Tropical Semi-Evergreen, Tropical Moist Deciduous, Littoral and Swamp, Tropical Dry Deciduous, Tropical Thorn, Sub-Tropical Broadleaved and Montane Wet Temperate forests.        Forests represent all actually forested area on the lands classed or administered as forest under any legal enactment dealing with forest, whether state owned or private. The forest area of the state during 05-06 is 21,34000 ha accounting for 16.43% of the total geographical area of the state. Erode district with an extent of 2,28,749 ha under forest is the highest among districts in their contribution to the forest area of the state. This works out to 10.8% of the state’s total forest area. This is followed by krishnagiri district with 2,02,409 ha (9.6%) and Dharmapuri with 1,64,177 ha (7.8%). The unique feature of the Nilgiris district is that about 56% of the total area of the district is under forests followed by Krishnagiri with 39.4%, Dharmapuri with 36.5%, Kanyakumari with 32.4% and Theni with 32.0%. Erode, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Vellore, Coimbatore, Thiruvannamalai, The Nilgiris, Dindigul, Salem, Thirunelveli and Theni Districts together accounted for 80.1% of the total forest area of the state. Protected Areas The state has 5 National Parks and 21 Wildlife Sanctuaries and one Conservation Reserve spread over an area of 3,829.8 km2 which comprises 2.94% of the geographical area. Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, Mudumalai and Mukruti National Park are prominent protected areas. The state has two Biosphere Reserves, namely, Gulf of Mannar and Nilgiris. Joint Forest Management The resolution for involving local communities in the management of forests was issued by the Government in 1997 which coincided with the launch of JBIC Project. There are 1,367 JFM Committees managing about 0.48 million ha of forest area as on March 2005, which is about 21% of the forest area of the State. More than 0.24 million families are involved in this programme, of which around 10,000 families belong to the Scheduled Tribes. Water harvesting structures form an important component of the JFM programme. FOREST COVER Top The forest cover in the state, based on interpretation of satellite data of October 2008-May 2009 is 23,625 km2which is 18.16% of the state's geographical area. In terms of forest canopy density classes, the state has 2,948 km2area under very dense forest, 10,321 km2 areas under moderately dense forest and 10,356 km2area under open forest.

This effect is particularly marked on the main continental land masses within the tropics as in the north Indian plains where during the long dry seasons the hot dry surface transfers heat energy to the wind. The denuded, over grazed and over-cropped areas in such situations increase the desiccation of land immediately downwind. In such circumstances, forests have an appreciable effect on the climate. Forests also tend to increase the relative humidity of the air and retard evaporation. In this way forests afford protection to animals and crops against strong, cold or hot and dry winds, and rays of the sun and prevent desiccation and vegetative retrogression. Forests tend to increase local precipitation, atleast to the extent of increasing the number of rainy days. Forests enrich the soil with fallen leaves and debris and increase its depth, porosity and water storage capacity. In hilly terrains, forests regulate the water supply, feeding springs in dry weather, promoting a perennial instead of a seasonal stream flow and tending to prevent sudden and violent rises of water during rains and floods. Forests help to prevent soil erosion, landslips, shifting sands and silting up and consequent overflowing of rivers, thus reducing the dangers of floods. On level ground, forests have a draining action; the clearing of forests on wet land increases its swampiness, which in arid regions it may increase the salinity of streams. Forests supply timber, fuel, pulpwood and other varied products, which in turn support major industrial activity in various sectors and provide large-scale employment. Finally, forests are the home of wildlife, and afford important aesthetic and tourist values. They have vital biological importance because of the floral and fauna associated with them. IMPORTANCE OF TREES Top A great emphasis is placed on trees in this Web module. This emphasis on trees reflects their ecological, biological, and cultural importance. Also, trees are critical to the classification of forests. Trees represent some of the oldest living organisms on the planet. For example, bristlecone pines, sequoias, and cypress are all long-lived species of trees. Trees were instrumental in the development and support of civilizations. They form important links in the earth's geological, chemical, and hydrological cycles by: Taking in CO2 and releasing oxygen; Releasing carbon and mineral elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus (important in plant growth) as they decay; Absorbing moisture for growth and releasing it as vapor through transpiration; Preventing erosion by reducing the force of rainfall at the soil surface and by intercepting and absorbing water, rather than allowing it to run off directly; Harboring a diversity of wildlife; Acting as windbreaks; Providing us with shade and beauty on a largely agricultural and urban landscape. DEFORESTATION Top Deforestation is defined as the destruction of forested land. It has proved to be a major problem all over world. However, the rates of destruction of forests are particularly high in the tropics. Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested land, for uses such as: pasture, urban use, logging purposes, and can result in arid land and wastelands. Causes The causes of deforestation vary form place to place. The most common causes are unscientific logging, agricultural expansion, wars, mining,conversion of forest areas for other purposes and urbanisation. Effects Deforestation has been the cause of many problems facing the world today such as erosions, loss of biodiversity leading to extinction of plant and animal species, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming. STATUS OF INDIAN FOREST Top In India, large scale unscrupulous deforestation began in the 19th century with the arrival of the British colonialism. In 1823, Thomas Munro, a Governor of the Presidency, did away with the position of forest conservator, believing that the laws of supply and demand would encourage someone to provide forestry programs privately. This grave mistake caused India four decades of rapid logging without any tree planting. Railroads and roadways built by the British further worsened the situation. In 1864, the German Forester Dietrich Brandis was brought to India by Governor-general Lord Dalhousie in an attempt to fix the problem. Although a forest act and heavy recruitment in a new forest department were ensured, it wasn't until another decade passed that forest reserves began to be set aside under the Indian Forest Act of 1878. These reserves however, were no sure-fire way of conquering deforestation. The livestock of villagers were herded into the reserves when village fodder was depleted. Solutions such as fencing-in grazing lands were monumental tasks that required flawlessness. Even today, grazing and the gathering of firewood in reserves continue to be a cause for formation of degraded forests. In some of the more arid areas of India, tree-planting programs are backed by the Drought-Prone Area Program. In many areas however, villagers overrun these projects before the trees begin to have a chance. Penalties for such things as cutting down trees are waived, never collected, or are so minor that offenders don't mind constantly paying them. AFFORESTATION Top Afforestation is the process of establishing a forest on land that is not a forest, or has not been a forest for a long time by planting trees or their seeds. The term may also be applied to the legal conversion of land into the status of royal forest. REFORESTATION Top The term reforestation generally refers to the reestablishment of the forest after its removal, or planting more trees for example from a timber harvest. Since the industrial revolution many countries have experienced centuries of deforestation, and some governments and non-governmental organisations directly engage in programs of afforestation to restore forests and assist in preservation of biodiversity. Reforestation is the restocking of existing forests and woodlands which have been depleted, with native tree stock. The term reforestation can also refer to afforestation, the process of restoring and recreating areas of woodlands or forest that once existed but were deforested or otherwise removed or destroyed at some point in the past. The resulting forest can provide both ecosystem and resource benefits such as: pollution control, dust control and has the potential to become a major carbon sink.
