Your shopping bag is empty. Go to the shop WiNaturals Home WiNaturals Offers certified organic products with aim to revert nature friendly farming practices. Based at Kolkata WiNaturals was established in 2012. Mr. Basant Kumar, Mrs. Shanthi Basant Kumar, Mr. Siddharth Natarajan and Mr. Radhakrishnan are the partners. Increasing damage caused by chemical fertilizers inspired the founders to form the company in order to revert to the most reliable, resilient, and environment friendly farming practices. The company is one of the first companies dealing in Humic and Fulvic acids to be certified as organic by an APEDA accredited institution under the NPOP program. WiNaturals has grown exponentially from starting business in one state initially to working in more than 9 states. The company plans to increase its network in the coming fiscal. WiNaturals’ products are not crop-oriented. They get the soils’ workability right and enhance its fertility, which may have gone haywire because of excessive use of chemical fertilizers over the years. The company currently deals with 4 products: • Progro G – Granular Humus based Plant Growth Promoter enriched with Neem • Provic 5000 XP- concentrated Fulvic Acid combination which is instrumental in supplying vital electrolytes to plants and accelerates photosynthesis and protein synthesis while stimulating metabolism, thus increasing the number of leaves, flowers, tillers and branches. Progro Z Liquid humus concentrate fortified with zinc naturally is available while extracting humic acid from Leonardite. • Protect S30 – Silica based Plant Growth Promoter and a Natural Fungicide which acts as an excellent anti-transpirant and anti-stress agent These products are certified organic. Progro G has been fortified with Fulvic Acid granules and enriched with Neem. The presence of neem ensures consistent, constant, and sustained supply of all nutrients in the right dose at the right time throughout the growing phase of the plant. The ideal dose of FYM is about 2500 kgs per acre, but farmers generally us 1/5th dose. If the ideal dose is maintained, even at a minimal cost of Re1/- per kg, 2500 kgs of cow dung would cost Rs 2500/-. The storage and application of this bulky input at Re.0.50 per kg at Rs. 1250/- totals to a minimum expense of Rs 3750/- per acre for the most common organic input. On the other hand the cost of PROGRO G @ 10 kgs per acre even at the MRP price works out to only Rs. 1700/- per acre which is less than half of FYM. Mr. Basant Kumar is of the opinion that farmers who use such products are often ignorant of the complete technical details about the products. Most of the users do not understand the mode of operation or the logical benefits of using such products in the long run. “Try and understand the simple logical science behind each operation rather than blindly believe the company sermons and you can choose for yourself the best products from the basket that contains more bad eggs than good ones,” Mr. Basant suggests. He goes on to discuss the key areas to be addressed by a farmer while using organic inputs. “To reduce input cost and increase the yield are the major concerns of a farmer. Our products reduce the need of any type of inorganic inputs by about 20% every year. Thus the expense that is saved can be used to buy our inputs. Thus your input cost is substantially reduced over a period of time,” he adds. The company is currently working on launching new products, like bio pesticides and bio fungicides. It aims to offer to the end user a complete package of organic practices from soil nourishers to plant health to stress resistance to insect repellent. It also plans to market organic outputs grown exclusively with its organic inputs in the next fiscal. Mr. Basant is an accountant by profession with about 3 decades of experience in some of the best known corporate addresses of the country. He has passionately studied Humic Acids and its applications on his own for over a decade.
