Group farming is possible. Some benefits are available from the government. Tamil Nadu government gives subsidiaries.

Government should take steps in the direction of providing premium market for organic products, financial incentives to entrepreneurship ventures, Skill development trainings and adequate infrastructure in the form of cold chain and processing. Group farming helps in bargaining cost of inputs, encourages farm mechanization which is very meagre in India and farmers have a better say in product marketing.

So with farmers, the government should stop subsidies and change in tax system. If the manufacturer has to pay less tax on raw material purchase automatically product will become cheaper in cost. In India group farming up to some extent help small farmer but it is not a permanent solution.

Tamil Nadu Banana Growers Federation says- Individual farming is certainly possible. That is India’s core strength and weakness as well. Asian countries like japan, china, Korea also have small holdings. They have brought in small and user friendly mechanisation. India is no way lacks behind the research in the field of agriculture. Every were we find the failure of extension agencies in effectively transferring the technologies and awareness to the farmers. There is absolutely no need of discriminating small and big farmers. Personally I cannot accept why farmers should ask for subsidy. Definitely Need based subsidy is a must for the farmers of India. After the economic liberalization the government has failed to improve the status of the Indian farmer to raise to the level playing ground across geographies. Ever increasing economic insecurity and climatic vagaries has virtually crippled the Indian farmers. Why the Rural employment Guarantee scheme for agricultural labourers. Government pays money to labourers for not working productively. Knowing fully well they have it as a social welfare. Not to speak of the leakages in huge disbursements right from village sarpanch to the jila parishads. Co-operative farming is written down principle. It looks future agriculture is going to be corporate style. small holdings will automatically get allied to join in one fold .But government policies have to be so amended for such ventures. We have just started to venture in to one such activity of uniting grower societies each member holding a minimum of one hectare land and becoming member of the society and in turn share holder of the FPO company.

In every field there are leaders who show the way. Masanobu Fukuoka from Japan, Shri Bhaskar Save from India are two such examples. They did wonders as an individual farmers. However, small individual farmers who do not have an identity and are not doing something different are completely exploited by the trade. Group farming and marketing through farmer’s cooperatives holds much better promise than individuals struggling for survival in the web created by greedy middlemen. As far as organic farming is concerned, my personal opinion is that if one understands the nuances of organic farming perfectly, output through organic methods in open cultivated and semi protected segment of farming rival if not exceed that from farming methods derived through use of chemicals and at a fraction of the cost. Whether that will be the future will depend purely on market forces. In the West, consciousness about the benefits of organic food is growing very fast. There is good market for organic food and farmers are opting to produce organic food. In India, the market for organic food is still very limited and if I may say so somewhat elitist. Also the key to success in organic farming is not following procedures by rote, but through understanding. This requires prolonged observation of nature and dedication which few people of the newer generation are willing to undertake. Therefore, spirited organic farming will largely remain an individual effort. Organic farming may become more broad- based in the future in case the drive comes from the market when there is a high premium for organic products. In that case, farmers might flock to produce organic products to make their money, but organic farming without conviction and understanding is as inane as following a package rolled out for any other system of cultivation where consideration for achieving higher income is the sole guiding factor. As far as farmers adopting latest technologies is concerned, I am very much in favour. Latest technologies need not be something very high- tech. E.g Compost tea making for giving microbial fertilisers is a very simple inexpensive process. It was first started in 2004. If farmers adopt the same, farmers will be able to save thousands of rupees in terms of cost of fertilizers, manure and pesticides individually every year and the nation tens of thousands of crores of rupees in foreign exchange. As far as the suggestion that farmers should stop expecting subsidies is concerned, I may mention that farm subsidies are doled out in almost all countries of the world and it is an economic necessity. E.g It is in every citizen’s interest that sugar price be kept low. If sugar prices are to be kept low, cane prices have to be low. A farmer cannot afford to produce cane at low rates if he were to pay for power for irrigation at rates prevailing for industrial customers.

K. Gautam (CEO) Udyam Nurturing Agribusiness says- I feel subsidies and concessions are the main culprits and the main reason for creating inefficiencies in the market. I believe farming both as group and individual is possible. However we should have economic size of land holdings to optimize production cost and use of technologies. Nowadays technologies are also available for small farms and therefore reach of these technologies should be easy to the farmers. I advise balance crop nutrition (INM - Integrated nutrient management) along with IPM (Integrated pest management) with low MRL levels and safe and nutritious food besides being only pure organic.
