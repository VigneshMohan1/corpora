It was previously a part of the state that was earlier known as Andhra Pradesh. Before India became independent it was included in the state of Hyderabad, which comprised two divisions, namely, Warangal and Medak. At that time the region was governed by the Nizams. The region has been in news recently as the focal point of a tussle between the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh and the national administration - while the Union Government has agreed to the creation of the new state, Andhra Pradesh has opposed it on grounds of territorial integrity. The region, as per the 2011 Census, has a population of 3, 52,86,757, which accounted for 41.6% of the population of Andhra Pradesh.

There had been several movements but the most important ones happened during 1969, 1972 and 2009. Over the years, the movement only gathered a lot of steam. The process of creating the separate state of Telangana was initiated on 9 December 2009 with a formal announcement from the Indian Government. However, as a mark of protest against this decision, MLAs and MPs from the Rayalseema and Coastal Andhra areas tendered their resignations. These regions also saw some violent protest after the said announcement. As a result of all these, the Indian government was forced to put the process on the backburner on 23 December 2009. The Telangana movement, however, continued unabated in Hyderabad as well as other districts of the region. However, the process began yet again on 30 July 2013 when the Congress party decided to plead with the Indian Government to create the new state of Telangana. It was decided that Hyderabad would continue to be the joint capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for the next decade. The process met with the approval of the Union Cabinet on 3 October 2013. A Group of Ministers (GoM) draft bill on Telangana was approved by the Indian Government on 5 December 2013, following which the bill was submitted to the Parliament so that both the houses could vote on the same. The 15th Lok Sabha voted in favour of creating a new state on 18 February 2014 and the Rajya Sabha followed suit on 20 February 2014. Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India, provided his consent to the decision on 1 March 2014 and the Gazette notification for the same was brought out on the same day. It was announced by the Indian Government on 4 March 2014 that the new state of Telangana would be created and hence it was formed on 2 June 2014.

Telugu is also the medium of instruction in the schools and colleges of the state. Government and Politics: Telangana is also governed by Parliamentary system like in other states. The system is divided into three different branches. The Executive authority lies with the Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister of state.

A system of lower courts and the High Court of Hyderabad takes care of the judicial system of Telangana. The major political parties in the state are Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Indian National Congress (INC). Telangana came into being after Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by Parliament for carving out the Telangana state comprising ten districts from north-western Andhra Pradesh, in February 2014. The state of Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014.

The Electronics Corporation of India Limited and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Hyderabad are some famous research institutes in the state. Why is it called Telangana? It is said that both the name Telangana as well as the language in circulation in the state has come from the words Trilinga or Trilinga Desa, which means the country of the three lingas. As per a Hindu legend, Shiva came down on three mountains called Kaleshwaram, Draksharama and Srisailam as a linga. These mountains basically acted as the borders of the region and are supposed to be situated somewhere between the rivers Godavari and Krishna. The word is also used in order to separate the Telugu- speaking region from the Marathi dominions and designate it as a part of the state of Hyderabad. Why was Telangana created? The supporters of Telangana have cited discrepancies and deprivation in many areas such as water resources distribution, jobs and allotments of budget as the basic reasons for creating a new state. The region used to contribute approximately 62% of the revenues generated in Andhra Pradesh. It has been stated that even though it had almost 69% of the catchment areas of both Godavari and Krishna, it received only around 19% of the benefit provided by the various irrigation projects. It has also been alleged that in majority of the years the state government did not spend the money allotted for the development of Telangana. Professor Jayashankar has estimated that only 20% of government employees are recruited from the region. As far as the secretariat is concerned, the count goes down to around 10% and only 5% of the officers who lead various departments are from Telangana. He has also pointed out that in the 50 years of the state's existence, chief ministers from Telangana have served for only six-and-a-half years. The proponents of Telangana have also pointed that the state legislature as well as the Lok Sabha has failed to honour the various agreements, promises and plans and this has left the state in a lurch of neglect, backwardness and exploitation. Controversy and objection in creating Telangana Ever since the creation of Telangana was announced, there was a lot of protest from various politicians in Andhra Pradesh. However, a major incident occurred on 13 February 2014 when the speaker Meira Kumar allowed the introduction of the bill at 1200 hours. A lot of slogans were being shouted and it was at this time that Lagadapati Rajagopal, the then Congress MP from the Vijaywada constituency, used pepper sprays. He, later, went on to say that he had used it in self defence since MPs from other states had attacked him. His actions caused a lot of disturbance to the proceedings of Lok Sabha and some members of the lower house of Parliament had to be hospitalised. Several Andhra MPs also faced suspension from the Lok Sabha as a result of their actions. They were: Indian National Congress Sabbam Hari A Sai Prathap Anantha Venkatarami Reddy Suresh Kumar Shetkar Rayapati Sambasiva Rao KRG Reddy SPY Reddy Bapi Raju Kanumuri M Sreenivasulu Reddy G Sukhender Reddy V Aruna Kumar Telugu Desam Party Niramalli Sivaprasad K Narayana Rao Nimmala Kristappa YSR Congress M Rajamohan Reddy Y Jaganmohan Reddy In addition, both the Legislative Assembly and Council of Andhra Pradesh have opposed the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. As many as 9 petitions have been registered in the Supreme Court against the same. Effects of Telangana Creation As per political experts there could be various effects of the creation of Telangana. The main argument of the supporters of this decision is that it would be easier to administer a smaller state like Telangana. However, judging by the way Jharkhand has been governed since its creation such an argument may not hold much ground. It is also expected that the creation of Telangana would lead to further instability in India as similar other movement such as Gorkhaland, Vidarbha and Bodoland will only gain ground.
