A large population base, rising income level and rapid urbanization leads to growth in this sector. In the Federal structure of the Indian polity, the matters pertaining to the housing and urban development have been assigned by the Constitution of India to the State Governments. However, the Union government is responsible for formulation and implementation of social housing schemes. Our section on housing highlights various initiatives and schemes implemented by government for rural, urban and EWS housing.
