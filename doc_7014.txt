The Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service provides technical information and educational programs designed to help Oklahoma agricultural producers as they implement strategies and practices to improve the sustainability of their agricultural operations.        Much of the technical information is derived from research-based knowledge generated by the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station at Oklahoma State University and the Langston University Research Program, as well as through the Land Grant University network around the country. These institutions employ a myriad of means to promote the sustainability of agriculture including: basic and applied research projects, training for cooperative extension field staff and personnel from many of the agencies and non-governmental entities working with agricultural producers, educational programs and demonstrations for producers, written information, one-on-one producer assistance, business development and planning, pilot plant operations, and much more.        The Oklahoma Sustainable Agriculture Program closely cooperates with several broad-based sustainable agriculture programs such as the Southern Region and National Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) programs funded by the USDA and EPA, related programs of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and the Kerr Center for Sustainable Agriculture.        This website is designed to help the user get information about the Oklahoma Sustainable Agriculture Program as well as connect the user to useful sustainable agriculture-related websites around the state and nation.   Document Actions Send this Print this « May 2015 » May Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31   Stillwater Tulsa Oklahoma City Center for Health Sciences Division of Agriculture Institute of Technology Veterinary Medicine Suggestion Box Accessibilty Safety Legal and Trademarks Webmaster © 2015 - Oklahoma State University | All rights reserved
