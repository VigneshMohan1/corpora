Pest birds destroy crops, damage automobiles and farm equipment and spread disease. At the very least, out-of-control bird populations contribute to a negative public image for cities plagued by large flocks. There are few birds as hearty and tenacious as the pigeon. Control of pigeon populations presents unique challenges for urban areas, where pigeons have long thrived. Tenacious in their roosting and feeding habits and extremely fertile, pigeons can quickly overpopulate in cities, creating health and safety hazards for human inhabitants. Other pest birds such as blackbirds, crows, cowbirds, grackles, starlings and house sparrows also cause up to tens of millions of dollars in damages to public and private property each year, making bird pest control not just a comfort but an economic necessity. The problem of pest birds is so widespread that it has spurred the creation of a number of pest bird management methods, many of which are ineffective or effective for only a short period of time. Avitrol Corporation offers a solution that utilizes a bird's natural behaviors to eliminate or reduce pest populations effectively. Avitrol, an acute oral toxicant, acts on the bird's central nervous system. The toxicant causes birds to involuntarily display behaviors that mimic the fright response and frighten away the remainder of the flock.
