Go to the shop Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Home Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Jalna based hybrid seeds manufacturer and supplier Dr. Usha Barwale Zehr Since its establishment in 1964, Mahyco has been a research-driven company with many firsts. It has successfully introduced hybrids in sorghum, bajra and cotton. Hybrids in many vegetables have also been introduced by the company. In more recent years, it explored and presented improved planting materials in rice and wheat to the farmers. In 2002 Mahyco introduced India’s first GM crop. Bt cotton by Mahyco revolutionized the cotton industry. New rice hybrids dhananjay, new hybrids in brinjal, okra which are resistant to viral diseases, and forage sorghum raseela are some recent hybrid launches of the company. Mahyco’s operations are spread across the country with stronger presence in central and southern zones. “We continue to expand in the North and East as products become available. In the east, the market has been growing as farmers are adopting higher yielding seeds compared to varietal market historically,” shares Dr. Usha Barwale Zehr, Chief Technology officer. The market for hybrid seeds is extremely competitive and for the product to be successful, it has to be high yielding and resistant to pests and diseases. In case of rice, wheat and vegetables, the quality of grain and fruit is also important. The company pays special attention to such features before consideration of its launch. Majority of the company’s customers are small and marginal farmers. The seed cost is 5% or less of all the inputs that a farmer deploys for the crop. Hence when a seed variant is well accepted in the market soon fly-by-night operators try to cheat the farmers by providing spurious seeds. “We take lot of effort to provide information to the farmers to buy seeds from authorized dealers, ask for a bill and not buy seeds from other sources. We also work closely with the government Agriculture officers to promote this message and share information,” informs Dr. Usha. The company values its farmers and works towards their welfare at various levels. One such example is organizing eye care camps for their production and commercial farmers. Mahyco also supports an eye hospital in Jalna Shri Ganapati Netralaya, which primarily caters to rural populations, including their farmer base. Their welfare activities also spread to areas of education. Through Barwale Foundation, the company is bringing technologies to improve specific crops which impact productivity in farmers’ fields. Speaking of Indian farmers’ attitude towards hybrid, Dr. Usha says, “Indian farmers adopt new varieties and hybrids which give them an economic advantage very rapidly. Wherever products are available, the farmer is keen to adopt them as they see a yield increase with hybrids.” Farmers normally combine organic and chemical fertilizers depending on what is available. Cow dung is the most common manure adopted by farmers. However the critical factor in this regard is the right amount of fertilization. Mahyco continues to work on its mission of bringing the best technologies to see Indian farmers become globally competitive and improve their livelihoods. Dr. Usha signs off saying, “Using new molecular breeding technologies, we hope to bring products to the market faster and address the challenges faced such as drought, salinity and fertilizer.” Our Correspondent Contact details: MAHYCO-Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company, Dawalwadi, PO Box 76, Jalna (MS) 431203, India Ph: 02482262371-375 Email: usha.zehr@mahyco.com Web: www.mahyco.com Source : Agriculture & Industry Survey Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Related – articles, consultants, downloads Yaaganti Seeds – hybrid seeds Nuziveedu Seeds – specializes in hybrid seeds Namdhari Seeds Incotec Seeds – Seed technology You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
