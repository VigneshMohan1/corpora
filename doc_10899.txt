Go to the shop Sai Durga Overseas Home Sai Durga Overseas Organically growing vegetables and trying hands on quinoa grain Embracing entrepreneurship was always a desire for Mr. S Durga Prasad Rao. He fulfilled it post-retirement from an export company. He established Sai Durga Overseas, a vegetable farm in 2012. The four acre farmland is located in a village called Gavara Jaggayyapalem in Visakhapatnam. Mainly ladies fingers, onions, green chillies, beetroot, and other very simple vegetables are grown by strictly following organic farming practices. In addition, on an experimental basis, “Quinoa” grain is also cultivated in one acre area recently. “I got the crop now. I intend to supply the quinoa seeds to many other prospective farmers in India,” shares Mr. Prasad. The annual production of vegetables is worth around Rs.2 lacs. The produce is sold to local merchants for re-selling, sometimes end users, and even to local star hotels. The policy followed is first come first served, be it an end user or a merchant. There is not much difference in price paid by these three sets of buyers but the difference lies in the quantity purchased. Usually, end user buys in small quantities while the brokers buy in bulk. Being a 100% organic farm, no chemical fertilizers or pesticides are used. Instead neem cakes, cow dung, vermicompost, bio fertilizers like panchgavya, bio insecticides and sprays prepared from country cow dung constitute the main farming inputs. Having never cared for the production in terms of quantity, Mr Prasad is always concerned about the soil fertility and quality of his vegetables. “Zero Budget Organic Farming” principles by Mr. Palekar are practiced at the farm. It is encouraging as it works wonders, states Mr. Prasad. He advocates saying, “veggies are tastier, harmless and with high nutritional values. One has to experience the difference and then share it. I am fetching a better price to my vegetables since they are organic.” As future plans, Mr. Prasad looks forward to associate with some other people who can suggest better crops under contract farming buyback like medicinal crops. “There is a huge market for medicinal plants but it depends on the farmer and his contract. So, I am expanding my farming abilities and trying to associate with other associates who can buy my crops easily,” he signs off. Our Correspondent Contact details: Sai Durga Overseas Mr. S.
