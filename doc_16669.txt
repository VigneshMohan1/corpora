FUNCTIONS OF FOOD Top Food may be classified according to their functions in the body. Physiological functions of food i. Energy yielding foods Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy yielding foods. They provide energy to sustain the involuntary processes essential for continuance of life, to carry out various professional, household and recreational activities and to convert food ingested into usable nutrients in the body. The energy needed is supplied by the oxidation of foods consumed. Cereals, roots and tubers, dried fruits, oils, butter and ghee are all good sources of energy. ii. Body building foods Foods rich in protein are called body building foods. Milk, meat, eggs and fish are rich in proteins of high quality. Pulses and nuts are good sources of protein but the protein is not of high quality. These foods help to maintain life and promote growth. They also supply energy. iii. Protective and Regulatory foods Foods rich in protein, minerals and vitamins are known as protective and regulatory foods. They are essential for health and regulate activities such as maintenance of body temperature, muscle contraction, control of water balance, clotting of blood, removal of waste products from the body and maintaining heartbeat. Milk, egg, liver, fruits and vegetables are protective foods. Social functions of food Food has always been the central part of our community, social, cultural and religious life. It has been an expression of love, friendship and happiness at religious, social and family get-togethers. Psychological functions of food In addition to satisfying physical and social needs, foods also satisfy certain emotional needs of human beings. These include a sense of security, love and acceptance. For example, preparation of delicious foods for family members is a token of love and affection.   2.

FOOD PYRAMID Top The food guide pyramid was introduced in 1992 by USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) as a general plan of what to eat each day. The food guide pyramid is a valuable tool for planning a health promoting diet. By incorporating the principle of balance, variety and moderation, an individual can still eat their favourite foods while following the food guide pyramid. Food guide pyramid Balance It means choosing food from different food groups. Variety This means including different foods within each food group. For eg. consuming a variety of fruits. Moderation This means keeping serving sizes reasonable. This involves self control. The food guide pyramid provides recommendation for the number of daily servings that should be consumed from each of the food groups.   BALANCED DIETS FOR ADULTS Food item Adult Man Adult Woman Sedentary work Moderate work Heavy work Sedentary work Moderate work Heavy work Cereals and millets 470 550 750 370 450 575 Pulses 40 60 60 40 45 50 Leafy vegetables 100 100 100 100 100 100 Other  vegetables 60 70 80 40 40 50 Roots and tubers 50 60 80 50 50 60 Fruits 30 30 30 30 30 30 Milk 150 200 250 100 150 200 Fats and oils 30 40 45 20 25 30 Sugar / Jaggery 30 40 50 25 30 30 BALANCED DIETS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS Food Groups Children Age in years Adolescents Age in years 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 13-15 16-18 Boys Girls Boys Girls Boys Girls Cereals and millets 180 275 285 335 300 410 340 460 325 Pulses 25 35 60 60 60 60 60 60 50 Leafy vegetables 40 50 50 75 75 100 100 100 100 Other  vegetables 20 30 50 50 50 75 75 75 75 Roots and tubers 10 20 30 30 30 50 50 50 50 Fruits 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 Milk 300 250 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 Fats and oils 15 25 30 30 30 50 40 50 40 Sugar / Jaggery 30 40 50 40 40 40 40 50 50 (For non-vegetarians substitute one pulse portion with one portion (50 g) of egg / meat / chicken / fish.)
