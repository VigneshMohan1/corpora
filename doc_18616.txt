Mineral Deposit The state government of Manipur has been developing the mineral industry for quite some time and measures have been taken to explore more into this field. The geological survey of India studies three districts namely; Churchandpur, Ukhrul and Chandel for minerals in its hill pockets.Considerable quantities of mineral deposits have been found here, like copper, salt, chromite, lignite, limestone, nickel and asbestos. However, the important mineral found here is lignite. Beds of lignite have been discovered in the southern part of Manipur. Careful extraction is necessary for the minerals to be extracted from their places. Government has proposed to work with the locals and bring out the minerals for its utilization. Minerals play an important role in the revenue of the state. As this state is rich in minerals, it has a bright future ahead of it. But there are some hurdles that are a setback to utilize more of the land for the production of these useful minerals. The total mineral production in 1990 � 91 was 130 tones and in 91-92 it was 64 tones. This alone valued for Rs. 114 thousands and Rs 42 thousands. In 93-94 the production was 642 tons and in 94-95 it was 784 tons. It decreased to 470 tons in 95-96 and 62 tons in 96-97. However, there is no production carried out since 1998 in the state of Manipur.The state is the only place to produce Chromite in the north eastern region.

Importance of Soil Conservation Manipur is a sensitive place ecologically and due to the population explosion, the place is slowly getting degraded as forest are being cut down at an startling rate and the atmosphere is getting polluted as well.If this goes go for long, it would be difficult for Manipur to stay the same beautiful place called the �Jewel of India'. Manipur state carries on agriculture on a large scale which makes it absolutely necessary for the government to take measure to ensure the soil remains on the land and does not wash away. The fertile top washes away if there are not tree roots to hold on to the soil. This leads to loss of soil which in turn can cause problems to the crops. If this is not stopped, huge loss can occur to agriculture and also to the atmosphere of the state. Government of Manipur has undertaken various programs that help to maintain the soil and thus help agriculture. It is also the responsibility of the people of Manipur to help maintain the ecology of the state. The state government and the central government have come up with programs that can help soil conservation to a large extent. Programs like the National Watershed Development project in Rain fed areas can help save the state from mass soil erosion as many trees will be planted on the barren lands and help water to sustain in the hills of the state. The soil of Manipur can be classified into four divisions like the Inceptisiols, Ultisols, Entisols and Alfisols. There are around 8 suborders of soil and 13 great groups and 23 sub groups. Soils like the Ultisols, Entisols and the Alfisols cover a total area of 38.4%, 36.4% and 23.1% respectively. 1.9 % comprises of lake and marshy land. The soil is conducive for crop and horticulture and is great for various other crops and fruits. Horticultural crops like pineapple, orange, lemon and pears etc can be seen grown in plenty in the state.Due to the geographical reasons, the soil conservation is significant for the ecology of Manipur.
