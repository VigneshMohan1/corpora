Go to the shop Earth Consultancy Home Earth Consultancy Offers consultancy services for aromatic and medicinal plants farming Earth Consultancy is a sole proprietor firm established in 2008. Apart from daily wagers appointed on different services, three employees work with the firm. Earth Consultancy initially provided services in agricultural field. It later turned into a firm that provided whole agricultural solutions in one platform. “I got the inspiration from certain firms working in that field having no technical academic back ground and finally I realised that I had the technical knowledge enough to run the business with satisfactory services to the customers” says Mrs. Mittal Pandya, the proprietor of Earth Consultancy. Providing positive results with least and reasonable charges is what Earth Consultancy does best. They also make sure that their project is sustainable and economically feasible within the given project estimate. Earth Consultancy provides around 150 species of plants specializing in aromatic and medicinal plants such as vetivar, lemongrass, palmarosa, menthol, Indianrose, patouli, geranium and citronella. The medicinal plants popular with the farmers include aloevera, asparagus, Indian ginseng, Indian basil, mentha etc. Mrs. Pandya believes menthol, asparagus, aloevera, Indian basil, and Indian ginseng have good fortune. Indian rose, patouli, lemongrass and citronella and also palma rosa are the aromatic plants he considers will carry the same fortune. With a return on investment at 1:2 medicinal plantation is an inviting profitable field. “Suppose its investment is Rs. 10000 per acre, then the returns will be Rs. 20000,” explains Mrs. Pandya. Earth Consultancy also deals with butterfly garden development and currently working with Taj Group of Hotels at Sasangir. Mrs. Pandya opines that agriculture is a profitable business but farmers aren’t professional enough to utilize its full capacity. Hence a professional business man entering into agriculture should be able to provide maximum benefits for both parties. “Always have trust in agriculture and it should be profitable and sustainable to those who know business and India is basically agriculture based country. So it is our responsibility to make our economy strongest in the world” Mrs. Pandya adds. However challenges cannot be evaded in such a field. Preparation and suitability along with sustainable projects selection are the main challenges faced by an agriculture consultancy business. Natural calamities and adverse conditions during whole season are some of the other challenges. Keeping its market demands in mind Earth Consultancy wishes to create more projects on medicinal gardening and horticulture with protective farming.  Mrs. Pandya has developed medicinal gardens in Gujarat and worked on projects for commercially medicinal & aromatic plantation, orchard development, new land development projects, and landscaping projects.
