Key indicators of success would be increased yields of crops, fish and livestock products - complemented by an increase in the proportion of marketed surplus. Although the over-riding objective is to stimulate the growth of Assam’s agricultural economy, project activities are predominantly pro-poor, directed primarily at small and marginal landholders, poor fishing communities and the landless. The project also aims to empower the poor farming communities (as clusters/ groups) by providing knowledge-tools-financial support for achieving higher agriculture productivity and facilitate efficient linkages with agriculture commodity markets for better remunerative prices and thereby ensuring an increase in farm family income.
