They include: Student Scholarships The renovation of historic Barn A on the Stillwater campus The support of 4 unique Endowed Centers for Excellence: the Equine Center, the OSU Botanical Garden, the Biobased Products and Energy Center and the Water Research and Extension Center.

The impact of additional scholarship support is immediate. It will help us increase enrollments, retain students and increase graduation rates. It will improve student performance by reducing the dependence on part-time and full-time employment by our full-time students. We will increase the number of students who will have had an international study experience by graduation and help students graduate with a significantly lower debt load. We will also be able to increase undergraduate involvement in research, leadership and teamwork development, and service learning.

With support from the Branding Success campaign, Barn A can be restored to its earlier glory with a new purpose - a premier conference center, which could provide much needed meeting space for campus and community events.  The downstairs would commemorate the 100-plus years of Oklahoma's farming and ranching community, remembering the roots of its original purpose.  The sweeping expanse of the former hayloft will become the Centennial Banquet Hall, featuring dining space for up to 250 people, as well as a catering kitchen.

This project would allow this university to better fulfill its land-grant mission across the state by providing for the needs of our students and citizens.

The plan includes expansion of the Oklahoma Gardening studio garden and teaching, research and outreach capabilities, as well as creation of 30 different educational gardens, natural areas, venues for art and cultural events, several miles of trails, and an environmental learning center.  The garden will serve as a place of enjoyment, will support educational and research functions, and is being designed to address the needs of all populations, including the disabled, youth and senior citizens.

With additional support, this center will help revitalize rural areas in Oklahoma by creating new biofuels-related production practices contributing to this state's well-established energy industry.

Yet, Oklahoma's water resources are complicated by the most diverse water environment of any U.S. state coupled with growing regional demand for water from all sectors of the economy. The ultimate result of support for the Water Research and Extension Center will be improved water-use decisions, a more dependable water supply and improved water quality to meet increasing demand for water.  Moreover, OSU will become a national leader in integrated, collaborative research and Extension programs that address water issues that affect quality of life of each citizen.
