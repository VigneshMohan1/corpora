I enjoyed learning about how different countries used animals for many different things. The instructor was excellent and really wants student to do well. He will help you understand or he will notice if your work is changing from your best. Please keep ANSI classes in the Correspondence Education office!" - S. Skipper Springer, OK USA “Thank you! The CE staff were most impressive. My perception was that they work very hard to keep the students connected to the class and instructor. They quickly answered any calls, emails or faxes sent." - J. Cochran Oklahoma City, OK USA “I would recommend these courses to others. These courses would be perfect to take over the summer or in addition to a couple of in-class courses." - A. Loyd Tulsa, OK USA “OSU maintains a high quality Correspondence Education program. This gives the adult learner with little time for classroom study another avenue to pursue a quality education. Thank you for offering this opportunity to those like me who continue learning from afar.” - R. Canzanella Clarksburg, NJ USA
