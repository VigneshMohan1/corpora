Without adequate pollination, crops won’t be fully developed, and the market doesn’t accept misshapen produce. We are already ahead of the game, being organic, where we’ve providing habitat for native pollinators, providing them with forage and not spraying the toxins that indiscriminately kill the good bugs and the bad bugs. “We have to build up our native pollinators, but until then, honeybees are playing a critical role in maintaining pollination in our agricultural system. One hive of honeybees has up to 30,000 individuals, whereas the native pollinators tend to be solitary, or, in the case of bumblebees, a very large bumblebee nest is maybe only 250 individuals. So honeybees, in terms of economics and providing pollination, are still the workhorses.” El Shaddai Global 1/19 A, Bajanai Koil Street, Vengaivasal, Kanchipuram – 600073 Mob: 9960896688 / 07305860061 Email: krishnappagopi@gmail.com / gopi.krish@hotmail.com Web: El Shaddai Global Reply With Quote August 20th, 2014 #16 guargum Join Date Mar 2013 Posts 418 Blog Entries 12 Bio-diversity is main part of the organic agriculture. Any natural activity which increase the production of farm should be included in organic agriculture. Natural pollinator play a major role in the agriculture production. the number of natural pollinator will increase the production. Now question is some crop require the external pollination some crop pollinate naturally. There is more importance of honey bee where male and female flower are separate or the male or female flower plant are separate, In the case of single flower plant , honey bee will increase the crossing. crossing is good for the production as dominant gene will give good production. Honey bee will also control the insect est. Honey bee must be included in organic agriculture. It will also increase the income of organic farm . Any natural process must be included in organic agriculture. Reply With Quote August 21st, 2014 #17 editorialteam Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 1,063 R. Durairaj, CEO and Founder, Mother India Farms says- Normally, bees travel a lot to nearby farms, which may not be practicing organic farming and use lot of pesticides, fertilizers, chemicals etc. So, we do not encourage Beehives at the organic farm and clear that Honey or pollinators should not be included as a component of organic farming. An organic farm surrounded by a forest only can have a beehive at their farm and the nature of honey will be organic. Hence, it is very rare to find organic Honey.

Though the honey bees are best known for the honey they produce, their economic role in nature is to pollinate hundreds and thousands of flowering plants and assure setting of seed or fruit. Honey bees thus play very important role in cross pollinating various agricultural and horticulture crops and increase their yields and improve their quality.

Though I do not have much knowledge on this subject but I can sense that organic farming may also benefit crop pollination as organic farming has the potential to mitigate the negative effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. The conversion to organic farming may rapidly increase pollination success and hence benefit the ecosystem service of crop pollination regarding both yield quantity and quality. Among all native pollinators, honey bee in Indian context one of the most important issues these days. Commercially, honeybees are by far the most common managed pollinator. By understanding native bee biology, nesting habits, and the toxicity of various organic sources, farmers can effectively balance their crop management strategies with the needs of their resident pollinators.
