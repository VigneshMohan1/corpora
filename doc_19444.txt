The Ahmedabad Vadodara Expressway, also known as National Expressway 1, is a major lifeline for public transport connecting the cities of Ahmedabad and Vadodara in the state of Gujarat. The 95 km long expressway reduces the travel time between the two cities from about two and a half hours on National Highway 8, which is one of the busiest national highways in the country, to an hour now. This expressway was opened in 2004 by then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee who dedicated the first phase of National Expressway between Ahmedabad- Vadodara to the nation. This new expressway has two lanes on each side and one service lane. Two exits are provided for Nadiad (50 kms from Vadodara) and Anand (35 kms from Vadodara). This expressway is part of the Golden Quadrilateral project by the NHAI (National Highway Authority of India). Two wheeler vehicles are prohibited on the expressway due to safety reasons. The Ahmedabad Vadodara Expressway was one of the major highlights of the India Shining campaign by the BJP (Bharatiya Janta Party) coalition government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Ahmedabad Vadodara Expressway, which passes through Kheda and Anand has come as a blessing to trade between both these important cities in Gujarat, considering Vadodara is an important chemical, pharmaceuticals, cotton textiles and machine tools hub and the city of Ahmedabad is famous for its textile and garment industry, apart from being a major exporting hub. This expressway has come to assist and promote trade between both the cities, since traveling time between the cities has been reduced considerably.
