The essence of this new approach is transforming traditional organisations into learning organisations. We believe that organisational learning is a process of continuously redefining people's beliefs and perceptions about how things work. We are proud that we, at IFS, have been handling this crucial role of developing a learning culture in the Food Corporation of India with a strong commitment and a result-oriented approach. IFS, under the aegis of FCI, has evolved into a premier institution, contributing towards the expansion of knowledge base in the area of food grains management.It's my privilege to welcome you to the Institute of Food Security.
