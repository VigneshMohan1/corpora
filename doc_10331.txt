Singh Dr. Mam C. Singh, senior scientist, division of floriculture and landscaping at Indian agricultural research Institute, New Delhi has extensive experience of 15 years working on protected cultivation of flower crops. He holds Ph.D. in floriculture from IARI, New Delhi, and post doctor (light response) from Netherlands, Wageningen University. Presently he is working on low cost poly-house cultivation, especially on chrysanthemum for off-season growing to standardize production technology. He reminiscences best moments as providing farmers friendly technology for N-Indian climate to grow cut flowers under poly-houses and shade nets. He avers, “tough moments were when extreme temperatures soared up in Delhi and NCR put lot of difficulties in my work with rose, gerbera and carnations to grow round the year.” Growing Flowers in Greenhouse Greenhouse cultivation aims to provide a comfort zone to the crops safeguarding from harsh sun, rains, low temperature and lodging against winds etc. Dr. Singh says,” inside poly-house we cultivate high volume of crops that is high planting density. The ideal flowers to be grown commercially in protected cultivation are roses, chrysanthemum, orchids, carnations, lilium and gerbera where we need an exceptional quality for domestic and foreign export as well. However, chrysanthemum is the most suitable and profitable flower to the farmers as it is always in high demand.”  Growing flowers in greenhouse is expensive from the farmers’ point of view as climate varies from place to place. “Selecting a crop as per market demand is important. If we say a 1000 sqm poly-house/ greenhouse cost is approximate 900/- to 1500/ INR per sqm area, the per year cost would be around 45000/-INR per year as fixed cost but the returns are proven to be approximately Rs. 3.5 Lakhs per year from gerbera and rose in NCR region of Delhi and Pune. Therefore in a long run it is profitable if someone can match the production as per market demand. Normally if a farmer gets subsidy, return on investment is attained in three years and if not then surely in five years of time,” maintains Dr. Singh. Challenges in Floriculture Huge variation in climate is the main challenge in floriculture that affects every time to standardize the package of practices. Dr. Singh adds, “another challenge is even when we had an excellent crops, also in the farmers field the market demand is erratic or not stable every year to fetch calculated returns.” Floriculture Courses At Indian Agricultural Research Institute 13 courses are offered in floriculture covering breeding of flower crops for novel traits, post-harvest, production technology and protected cultivation etc. Recently the course on Value Addition in Flower crops and Export Oriented Horticulture has also been added. Dr. Singh concludes saying, “Compared to any other cultivation, flower farming is more profitable, especially in peri-urban areas where there is vicinity of market and high demand. Even if the products are perishable they can now be used for making several value-added products, like dry flowers, cards, embedding , monographs including natural color/dyes etc., what we can call a wealth from the waste.” Our Correspondent For more information, contact : Dr Mam Singh, Senior Scientist Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi-110012 Mobile: 09899066228 Email: mamsingh@gmail.com Web: www.iari.res.in Source : Agriculture & Industry Survey Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Dr. Mam Singh – floriculture, greenhouse Related – articles, consultants, downloads Mr. R.G.
