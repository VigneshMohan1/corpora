Modernising Extension and Advisory Services is involved with trying to help extension and advisory professionals to use tools to reach farmers effectively and believes that Access Agriculture will be one means of helping spread information in local languages. The  Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform), the global food and drink industry initiative for sustainable agriculture, is another organisation endorsing and promoting Access Agriculture’s aims.  As part of its activities, SAI Platform is committed to improving the livelihoods of their producers/suppliers. Other organisations whose video productions are featured on accessagriculture.org include AfricaRice, CABI, CIAT, CIMMYT, Ghent University, VU University Amsterdam, ICRISAT, IFAD, IFDC and IRRI.
