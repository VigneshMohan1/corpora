The OSU University Club provides an opportunity for regular interaction among various constituencies of the OSU community; thereby promoting collegiality and enhancing communications within and between these constituencies. Membership of the U CLUB is drawn from OSU faculty, OSU staff, Administrators, Emeritus faculty/staff, Full time graduate students, and University patrons. The U CLUB logo, the keystone, is a widely displayed architectural feature across the OSU campus. It reminds us that the U CLUB is a keystone strengthening communication and collegiality among and across the OSU community. The U CLUB motto is “ Lasting Friendships ” and represents the most significant benefit of the U CLUB. We often hear members say that their membership in the University Club has greatly enlarged their circle of friends and enriched their experiences at the University.
