During production of MDHF’s products, major emphasis is laid on purity, use of organic herbs, hygienic environment using no chemicals and safe packaging away from metals. “In terms of marketing the main challenges are to fight with MNCs and big groups who use all sorts of marketing strategies. Being farmers’ products, we cannot invest in a high budget,” says Dr. Rajaram Tripathi, C.O.O & Director. A major concern lies in creating awareness about certified organic products among people. Most people often fail to differentiate between ayurvedic and organic herbal products. MDHF is currently looking for distributors and stockists all over India to market their own farm produced certified organic herbal products. The firm wishes to come up with a range of organic products in food, medicine, cosmetics & groceries in the future. It also wishes to promote organic farming, medicinal and herbal farming. It will be inaugurating MDHP’s Africa office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 5th June. This office will focus on industrial cultivation of high quality herbals and generating employment for local youth and uplifting their life standards.
