Malagasy people used wild silk named Borocera Madagascariensis since a long time. Around 1850, Bombyx mori was introduced in Madagascar. Experience shown that sericulture can be undertaken profitably in the country. Mulberry growth in regions of Madagascar is continuous and silkworm rearing can also be done during eight (8) months in the year. This has been possible because the climatic conditions favor sericulture development; temperatures are more or less constant throughout the year (18 – 26°C in the central plateau). The state of Madagascar has got n 3 sericulture centers .These centers are in charge of silk egg production, they are responsible for selection and germ plasma conservation of parental pure strains, the production of egg (F1) to distribute to farmers,the popularization sericulture and the framing of policies benefiting the famers and technical improvement in mulberry plantation. But since 2003, after the disengagement of the State involving in the direct activities of production, sericulture centers have been given up to the private sector. The administration department involved only in the following activities: - To elaborate and to follow the application of texts to the sericulture - to support the expansion of sericulture area through another zone - to support the 3 centers that are managed by the private sector. The marketing of sericulture products like: silk, silkworm eggs, mulberry plants is in the hands of private traders who are basically unorganized. Types of Silk Two types of silks exist in Madagascar ; one is made from breeding silkworms and the other is the native silkworm Borocera Madagascariensis, living in the wild tree; tapia. But, it is endemic to Madagascar. The silk worm Borocera Madagascariensis are holometabolous, therefore they have three distinct morphological stages; larva, pupa and adult. After hatching from the egg, larvae go through four molts as they grow. During each molt, the old skin is cast off and a new, larger one is produced. The silk worm larval life is divided into five instars, separated by four molts. After they have molted four times (i.e., in the fifth instar), their bodies turn slightly yellow and their skin becomes tighter. The larvae enclose themselves in a cocoon of raw silk produced in the salivary glands that provides protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. image1 image2 image3 Statistics Production of cocoons (Tonnes)   2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Fresh cocoons (Bombyx mori) 60 60 70 80 80 85 85 85 100 non mulberry (Wild silk) 60 60 50 40 40 40 40 40 40 Exports (kg)   2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Dry coocons     10   2,5   7,02 0,5   Raw silk & Silk fabrics 1069 282 835,6 539,8 472,7 1531,1 647 785,7 2594,7 Imports (Kg)   2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Dry coocons                   Raw silk Spun-silk Silk noil 65 057 59 964 66 989 70 144 74 712 58 035 74 285 108 931 144 662 Employment generated Number of labours involved : around 8.000 families 4 – Infrastructure facilities available for development. The 3 sericultures Centers that managed by private sector Resources a) Mulberry varieties - 03 local varieties - 04 Varieties imported : Kanva 2 ; Kokuso 27;Lhou rose ; Multicaule ;Valencia There are approximately three million mulberry trees in Madagascar. While, the total area under cultivation of mulberry bushes does not exceed 200 hectare. b) Silkworm races Two main strains of silkworms are reared in Madagascar: multivoltine varieties and bivoltine varieties. The 3 centers maintain these silkworms - Sericulture center in ANTSIRABE, managed by NGO FAFIALA (private sector) maintain 14 bivoltines races - Sericulture centers in MAHITSY and AMBOSITRA maintain multivoltine races (private sector) 3) Reeling : Filature 100% of Raw silk is generated using the traditional reeling devices. Outlook The Government of Madagascar is committed to expand and diversify its economy. Sericulture production has been shown that Madagascar is well-suited for silk production, as it has a large supply of labor and a favorable climate. The development of the silk industry would employ large numbers of people in rural areas; It has been demonstrated that sericulture activity can produce high quality silk cocoons throughout the year and hence greater chances of profitability for whole commodity chain actors, including farmers and private sector. 6.1. The National Strategy for Sericulture Development The Ministry of Livestock is elaborating a strategy to address the main issues and constraints that could threaten sericulture development to harness the opportunities which can be offered by the sericulture industry for economic development of the country. The purpose of such a strategy is to provide a basis, a framework and guidance for sustainable development of sericulture industry. The sericulture strategy will focus on the following major issues: - Provision of support to production and marketing of silkworm eggs - Strengthening sericulture farmer’s organizations - Supporting cocoon production activities - Supporting value addition activities to sericulture products - Supporting research to improve sericulture farm and silk industrial productivity Afghanistan Bangladesh Brazil DPR Korea Egypt France Greece India Indonesia Iran Japan Madagascar Romania Syria Thailand Tunisia Copyright © 2013 Home Contact Feedback Terms of Use Privacy Policy Disclamer Netiapps
