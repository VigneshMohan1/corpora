The Department was then engaged in conducting crop cutting experiments on winter rice, mustard and sugarcane. The crop cutting experiments were then called agricultural experiments. The reason of conducting crop cutting experiments was to assess productiveness of land to prepare assessment proposals during settlement. There was no agricultural expert in the Department till 1897. In 1893, an Agricultural Conference was held in Simla. In accordance with the recommendations of this conference, Government of India deputed Sir E. Buck to Assam in 1895 to discuss with Assam Government about the recommendations. Sir E. Buck advocated appointment of an Agricultural Expert to (1) ascertain �agricultural defects� and (2) introduce agricultural improvements. In the year 1897, Mr. B. C. Basu a Deputy Collector of Bengal and a graduate of an Agricultural College in England was appointed as Assistant Director. Although Assam was a separate province it was amalgamated with Eastern Bengal in 1905. In the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam the Agriculture Department was separated in 1907 form the combined Department of Land Records and Agriculture. After the creation of a separate Department, expansion of the Department took place quickly. Assam became a separate province again in 1912 when the Agriculture Department was again combined with that of Land Records and continued up to 1922. In 1923 three allied Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Industries were combined.                           Best viewed at Mozilla Firefox v3.6 + OR Windows Internet Explorer v8.0 + Copyright � agriassam.in  All Rights Reserved Designed & Developed by  IT Group, AMTRON
