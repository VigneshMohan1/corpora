Yet, ironically, women have been neglected in the decision making issues related to agriculture and family welfare. This is more so evident in farming households which grow crops like cotton which contributes to the cash economy of the families. Chetna Organic would work on reducing the drudgery of women, capacitating women to access and control the production resources and play a major role in the decision making in household, community and institutional spheres.  Thrust Areas Building Sustainable Institutions Integrated Farming Systems Natural Resources Management Improving Livelihood Options Value Chain Development Food Security and Nutrition Seed Sovereignty Gender Mainstreaming and Child Welfare Copyright © Chetna Organic.
