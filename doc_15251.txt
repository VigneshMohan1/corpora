Jawaharlal Nehru, a multi-campus University, Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV) was inaugurated by the then Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Smt. Indira Gandhi on October 2, 1964. Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwavidyalaya (JNKVV), Jabalpur was established in 1964, as the biggest multi-campus university, with an approach to narrow down the gap between the experts and farmers, through Joint Indo-American Team on Agricultural Research and Education in 1954-55 and 1959-60 on the patterns of Land Grant Colleges of USA. In subsequent years, the University had to part with its area of jurisdiction due to creation of sister universities- Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya (IGKV) at Raipur in 1987, Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, Gwalior in 2008 and Nanaji Deshmukh Pashu Chikitsa Vigyan Vishwa Vidyalaya, Jabalpur in 2009.       The Central Administrative Office of the University is located about 7 km North of Jabalpur town on National Highway No. 7. At present, JNKVV encompasses five Colleges of Agriculture (Jabalpur, Rewa, Tikamgarh, Ganjbasoda and Waraseoni); one  College of Agricultural Engineering (Jabalpur); four Zonal Agricultural Research Stations (ZARS) (Jabalpur, Powarkheda, Tikamgarh and Chhindwara); four Regional Agricultural Research Stations (Rewa, Sagar, Dindori and Waraseoni); four Agricultural Research Stations (ARS) (Naugaon, Garhakota, Sausar and Tendini) and twenty Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) representing six agro-climatic zones spread over 25 districts. JNKVV has produced competent human resource for managing the activities of agriculture and allied sectors, and the need based research and its rapid dissemination has led to several improved technologies, which have played important role for increased production and productivity of crops on sustainable basis, as reflected in 18.9 % growth rate in total agricultural food   grain production during the year 2011-12 and 16.4 % during the year 2012-13 of the state of Madhya Pradesh.. The State ranks first in production of pulses, second in production of oilseeds and third in production of cereals at national level. The state’s contribution to the national food basket is about 11.2% (2012-13). The State received “Krishi Karman Award” at national level for two consecutive years, i.e. for the years 2011-12 and 2012-13. The area covered by the University is not only large but also diversified. Since its establishment the university has made laudable progress and has come to the expectations of the people of the state by greatly benefiting the farming community.         Current News Important Events Forthcoming Events   Tender Notification - Vacancy Notification    - Contact Us | Terms of Use | Trademarks | Privacy Statement Copyright © 2013-JNKVV, Hosted by-NIC, Maintained by JNKVV, Jabalpur
