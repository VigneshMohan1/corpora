The uniformity in dairy education among the dairy technology institutions has improved with the implementation of the Fourth Dean’s Committee Recommendations throughout India. While the standard of the graduates produced by the present Dairy Technology institutions is gradually improving , much needs to be done in terms of infrastructure and trained manpower at most if the institutions. e-Learning is the current trend in synchronous classroom education as well as asynchronous distance education.
