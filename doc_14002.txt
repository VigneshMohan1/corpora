INNOVATIONS A Value Chain on Industrial Agroforestry in Tamil Nadu has been implemented involving three Industrial partners and one Research partners in a consortium approach. Through this project, a contract farming model viz., Quad partite model has been successfully introduced in five districts involving 10 clusters with more than 250 beneficiaries and resulted in excellent adoption. watches USA online This Quad partite model contract farming has got a horizontal impact which resulted in promotion of Industrial Agroforestry in and around the target clusters and also outside the project site. The model contract farming promoted and adopted through NAIP project is furnished. 2. TECHNOLOGY A. Clonal Technology Trees in general are propagated through seeds which resulted in variability and poor productivity particularly in Casuarina. The current project has identified and developed a Clonal propagation technology for mass multiplication of elite genetic resources particularly in the species of Casuarina junghuhniana which resulted in early harvest of three years against five years in practice. The Clonal propagation methodology developed and adopted is furnished below. Clonal Mass Multiplication   B. In-vivo Clonal technology In-vivo Clonal technology has been developed and adopted for mass collection of cuttings and rapid multiplication of clones with quality standards. Under this process superior clones are grown under invivo condition viz., under shade house and polyhouse conditions and the clones are periodically pruned and the cuttings are collected and multiplied rapidly. fake watches uk This method is adopted by two industrial partners.
