The clones to be promoted in the current project will be harvested in 2 (Casuarina) to 4 (Eucalyptus) years as against 5 and 7 years respectively and help to achieve higher productivity in shorter period. Alternative genetic resource development New, alternate and high yielding pulp and matchwood species (at least one alternative species for each industry and 10 clones in each species) will be available through the project. Mechanization Introduction of mechanized harvest operations will help to improve the harvesting efficiency of 10 tonnes / day coupled with reduction in logging loss of nearly 1 to 2 tonnes / day. Post harvest technology and value addition The shelf life of harvested wood will be augmented through post harvest protection. The plantation and industrial residues will be value added through briquettes production. Supply chain The existing market system will be energized through the improved supply chain which will help the growers with efficient marketing system and remunerative price (Rs. 2000 tonne -1 or market price whichever is higher). Rural employment generation It is estimated that through plantation establishment, harvest and value addition will help to generate enough employment opportunities at village level (300 man-days ha -1 ) Industrial plantation as a source of carbon sinks The plantation is expected to sequester 0.5 t of carbon from 1 t of wood produced. Hence in 1 ha, it is possible to sequester 50 t of carbon which will help to develop clean development mechanism.
