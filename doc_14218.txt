Vegetative propagation like air layering, grafting, rooting of sprigs etc standardized. 300 Malis trained in clonal multiplication technology. 150 mist tents erected for Macro propagation. Plus trees in species, Casuarina equisetifolia and Casuarina junghuniana have been identified for maximum bio mass production per unit area. Plus trees speceies, Teak, Melia dubia have also been identified for the producation of good quality of timber in short duaration.

Planting techniques such as peripheral planting in 3m dia saucer, trench planting in tapering trenches, planting in the centre of saucer etc. were also tried for the above species. After four years it was found that the treatment of planting nine plants in periphery of three meter dia saucer in 45cm 3 pit with application of bio-fertilizer produced maximum survival compared to the rest of the treatments. The treatment namely 1m3 pit with bio-fertilizers produced better results for the production of maximum bio-mass. Similar package of practices experiments were carried out for the following species at different agro climatic zones.

STUDY ON SUITABLE MULCH MATERIAL An attempt was made to identify cost effective, suitable mulch material for Simaruba glauca . Mulch material like saw dust, Casuarina needles, wood shavings, polymer, paddy chaff, etc., were applied to 3-4 inches thickness upto one feet radius around each plant. Soil samples were collected at 60cm depth, before and three months after mulching and soil moisture % was tested and compared.
