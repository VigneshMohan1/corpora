Go to the shop Patel Farms – Fruits & Vegetables grower Home Patel Farms – Fruits & Vegetables grower Patel Farms is situated in Ankleshwar, Bharuch district in Gujarat state. It is 24 acres and currently fruits like Banana, Papaya and vegetables like Brinjal, Bitter Gourd, Bottle Gourd are grown. Mr.Harshadbhai Maganbhai Patel is the owner of the farm. He is a B.Com graduate and was in the farming field for the past 5 years. Floriculture farmers in Ankleshwar are facing problems to sell their produce as there is no good market. So one has to go to Pune or Mumbai to sell their products. Taking into account of transportation cost, the farmers are not getting much profit. Floriculture growers are suffering here for want of suitable market. Mr. Harshadbhai says that marketing of the end produce is a big problem. Though I sell my fruits and vegetables in and around my area, my fellow farmers who are in floriculture business are finding hard to sell their produce as there is no good market. Going to Mumbai to sell our vegetables is not profitable as one incurs expenses on transportation. “At present I have grown Banana which would go for three years. After that I will decide which one should grow. I use both organic fertilizer and also urea. I make my own Vermicompost and I am happy with the results. I suggest other fellow farmers to try the organic fertilizer,’’ Harshadbhai adds. “Indian farmers are uneducated and lack farming knowledge. Marketing of their produce is a problem and they should be guided about the different markets so that they can sell their produce. In this respect the government should come forward,’’ suggests Harshadbhai. For more information, contact :  Harshadbhai Maganbhai Patel, At- Juna Borbhatha Bet, Behind : Primery School, Nr.
