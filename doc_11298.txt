Go to the shop World Ayurveda Foundation Home World Ayurveda Foundation Promotes science of ayurveda, for the benefit of all ‘World Ayurveda Foundation is a platform that would take ayurveda to the world for all the benefits mankind can draw from traditional health sciences.’ World Ayurveda Foundation (WAF) is an initiative by Vijnana Bharati aimed at global propagation of ayurveda under Swadeshi Science Movement propaganda. WAF was established in 2011 at Bangalore funded by various trustees. “WAF is positioned to provide this much-needed leadership with its wide participation of various stakeholder groups,” says Mr. Chandrashekaran Nair, trustee and chief coordinator. Propagation and encouragement of all activities, scientific and ayurveda-related are the core principles. It also conducts World Ayurveda Congress once in two years. It supports research and health care program through camps, clinics and sanatoriums, documentation, organization of study groups, seminars, exhibitions, and knowledge initiatives to uphold ayurveda. WAF conducted AROGYA expo in Nov 2014 and is claimed ‘to be the largest fair in complementary and alternative healthcare in the world in the recent times.’ The expo witnessed participation of major Ayush industries from across India Central and State government organizations, hospitals, wellness centres, educational institutions research institutions, etc. Mr Nair shares the main decision taken was, “To propagate ayurveda in a positive way.” “In his talk during the valedictory session, the Hon’ble Prime Minster of India mentioned that at least 10% of biomedical research publications in peer reviewed international research journals should be represented by ayurveda,” shares Mr Nair and adds, “We have to go green in as many ways as possible.” Ayurveda advocates a change in attitude, lifestyle and the way we manage our environment. It also highlights that there is no substance in the world that does not have medicinal value.” There are as many as 10,000 potential medicinal plants of which only about 300-400 plants are being used. “We have to start using other plants, so that the demand on a few plants can be diffused,” views Mr Nair. Many medicinal plants have high demand and have export potential to be able to help a farmer financially through cultivation. “Some of the plants exported are sarpagandha, centella (also called as gotu kola), brahmi and ashwagandha,” he shares. These medicinal plants can also help add to the greenery in huge cities. “Cassia fistula, saracaasoca, pongamiaglabra are some trees that can be grown in urban areas,” Mr Nair shares, “Apart from that many herbs can be grown even in terraced homes and can be used as home remedies like coriander, mint, brahmi, and clitoria ternatea etc.” WAF endeavours to continue its activities to spread awareness on ayurveda globally for the greater benefits to mankind. Mr Nair concludes saying, “The problem is not the lack of list of medicinal plants, but lack of will to implement things.” Vignana Bharti is the science and technology promotion organization promoting ayurveda in country.
