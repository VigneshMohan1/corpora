Go to the shop SABMiller India – making barley cultivation profitable for the farmers Home SABMiller India – making barley cultivation profitable for the farmers Encourages farmers to grow malt barely. Provides technical assistance and purchases barely directly from farmers SABMiller India initiated the ‘Saanjhi Unnati’ (progress through partnership) program in the year 2005 at Rajasthan. “The immediate objective is to transform the feed barley cultivation to malt barley cultivation and making barley cultivation profitable for the farmers,” shares Mr. Kiran Reddy, Vice President-Barley Development, SABMiller India. “Currently we source about 65% of our barley requirement from Saanjhi Unnati initiative and the remaining 35% is directly purchased from matters.” The program helps meet the target of achieving a stable, secure source of malting barley to produce beverages. Having access to the higher-quality malting barley helps the company reduce the cost of brewing process. “It also helps in improving the quality and extending the shelf life of our products,” he adds. “The ‘Saanjhi Unnati’ programme is well entrenched in Rajasthan, Jaipur, Sikar, Alwar, Dausa and Jhunjhunu districts. Rajasthan contributes almost 60% of our requirement,” he informs. The program is also being expanded to Haryana (which contributes about 20%), Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand. “Over 9,500 farmers are associated with Saanjhi Unnati initiative across the states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh during 2014-15,” informs Mr Reddy. “A team of over 40 agronomists employed by SABMiller provide agronomical advice and training which they need to enhance the quality of their crops,” shares Mr Reddy, “Farmers receive hands-on-customized support from agricultural specialists with tips and information on barley cultivation.” Under this program, Saanjhi Unnati centres are set up which function as co-ordination and buying centers. Seeds are procured from the Govt. at a subsidized rate and passed on to farmers through these centers. “We only buy barley from our member farmers, who buy seeds from our centers,” Mr Reddy clarifies. Each center employs two technical advisors who give recommendations and instructions relating to the seed treatment, time of irrigation, method of fertilizer application, weeding practices, harvest timing and storage practices. Through these centers the farmers can also procure Govt. certified seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. The farmers come to these centers to sell their produce. Here the products are weighed and graded. “Farmers are paid on the spot for their crops,” he informs. The farmers are not contractually bound to sell the produce to the company. “However, SABMiller India assures the farmers, at the time of sowing a price that is profitable over a competing crop, provided it meets the quality standards which are pre-decided,” he shares, “We offer the farmers market price or minimum guaranteed price, whichever is higher.” In 2014-2015 the price offered by the company was 10% higher than that of the open market. For current year the company is offering Rs. 1300/- per quintal. The malt barley varieties that SABMiller is currently advocating to farmers (depending on different agro-climatic regions) include K551, RD2660, RD2715, RD2668, DWRB64, DWRB52 etc. Malt barley is graded on technical guidelines and factors such as the quality of seed, size of the seed, moisture level, grain contamination, net weight, hazardous substances in the sample, seed damage, odour, excreta etc. “The program has been successful in increasing the productivity of barley of the member farmers by about 14% and also by rolling out the minimum assured price, ensures profitability of a barley (member) farmer over the market price,” Mr. Reddy shares the success of the program. “SABMiller India is committed to expand the reach of the Saanjhi Unnati programme,” shares Mr. Reddy, “We will continue to work closely with the Rajasthan government on its seed development program to identify seed varieties that are best suited for the climate and soil in north-western India.” The company is also committed to encourage and develop quality barley cultivation in India.
