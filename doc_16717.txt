After pasteurization, the milk is immediately cooled to 5  or below. METHODS OF PASTEURIZATION In bottle pasteurization In this case bottles filled with raw milk and tightly sealed with special caps are held at 63 to 66  for 30min. Then the bottles passed through water space of decreasing temperature, which cool both the product and the bottle. In this case there is greater risk of bottle breakage also special types of water-tight caps required to be used. One of the advantages is that it prevents the possibility of post- pasteurization contamination. Batch/Holding pasteurization/Low temperature long time method In this case the milk is heated to 63  for 30min and promptly cooled to 5  or below and thus heating is done indirectly. The heat moves through a metal wall into the product for heating, and out of the product for cooling. The Pasteurizer may of 3 types. Water-Jacketed vat Water-Spray type Coil-vat type High temperature short time (HTST) pasteurization In this case large volumes of milk are handled and it gives a continuous flow of milk which is heated to 72  for 15 sec and promptly cooled to 5  or below. Vacuum pasteurization This refers to pasteurization of milk and there reduced pressure by direct steam. The equipment used is termed as ‘Vacreator’ and the process hence is known as ‘Vacreation’ Ultra high temperature pasteurization This method consists of temperature-time combinations of 135 to 150  for no hold (a fraction of second). The success of this method depends on immediate aseptic packaging. Uprization Uprization term means ‘Ultra- pasteurization’ where in milk is heated with direct steam up to 150  for a fraction of second and thus the process is continuous. Flash pasteurization  ‘HTST’. The formulation of the standards of pasteurization includes following points.
