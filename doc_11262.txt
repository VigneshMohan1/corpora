Go to the shop Tessa Flora Farms – plans to sell online Home Tessa Flora Farms – plans to sell online Tropical exotic flowers grown in South India and sold in North India Tessa Flora Farms was established in the year 2009 by group of friends in Kottayam, Kerala. It is a 15 acres farm in Kerala while another 15 acres are under cultivation in Sawantwadi, Maharashtra. The farm mostly has Heliconia cultivation along with Calatheas and Gingers grown in a few stretches. All crops are grown in open field. “Now we are trying for growing Orchids and Anthuriums in polyhouse,” shares Mr. Johnson Mathew, CEO. He states that taking the location advantage he and his friends decided to grow these tropical exotic flowers, and goes on to say, “The varieties we grow can only be successfully grown in tropical climate.” “Flowers are grown naturally, and we do not use any stimulant or hormone treatment to get flowers. Our flowers are very large. Some flowers have more than one meter length and with a stem length of around 1.5 meters,” says Mr. Mathew when asked about the special features of farm grown flowers. He adds, “We are producing flowers in South India and selling our flowers mostly in North Indian markets.” The demand for the flowers arises mostly for celebrations like marriages and festivals as flowers are used for decorations during such auspicious occasions. “As of now our flowers are getting good demand,” shares Mr. Mathew. Earlier such tropical exotic flowers were imported from Thailand. “Our customers are also happy as they get better than imported ones at a cheaper rate,” he adds. As the products are sold mostly in North India, transport and packaging costs are high. And during some months when festivals are not held and marriages are not conducted due to various reasons the demand goes down drastically. Therefore operational cost and earning always vary in floriculture business. “Our profits come from the demand season only and other months we operate just to have the presence in market,” says Mr. Mathew. As North India is the target market, the entire sales takes place through wholesalers at Tessa Flora Farms. “We sell mostly in New Delhi market which caters to the entire North India. We sell to other metro cities also. We have wholesale distributors in each city,” he shares. Some of the company’s dealings are done through florists who do floral arrangements in five stars hotels and large functions. Speaking of the labor requirement for the cultivation, Mr. Mathew says, “Developing stage requires more hands. For harvesting 5 or six people are required.” Harvesting is done round the year. In months to come, farm founders, Mr. Mathew and his friends plan to sell the farm produce online once anthuriums and orchids are ready. In addition they also look forward for contract farming with either Indian or foreign companies. “We are interested in growing herbs or raw materials for pharmaceutical industry as well,” signs off Mr. Mathew.
