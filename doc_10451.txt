He provides technical consultancy to implement large scale biogas plants with different types of waste materials. Farmers can convert variety of agro waste to biogas which can be used for either thermal applications or to produce electricity and organic fertilizer and earn revenue from the same. Through his consultancy services, Mr. Gopinathan has till date received good response from his clients. He was also a consultant for corporation of Calicut and Tellicherry municipality. A big project using molasses is under discussion in Mumbai. “I am a fermentation technologist. Since biogas is a fermentation product, I look into the intricacies of the process in detail and provide suitable technology so that the customer gets quality technical back up at low cost,” shares Mr. Gopinathan. Most farmers are not aware of the technical aspects of technology. Hence there are high possibilities of them being cheated by companies that are after money. Mr. Gopinathan says his services are inclined towards quality at affordable prices. His service is currently restricted to medium and large scale farmers only. Small farmers can even receive advice through phone. The minimum investment needed to set a biogas fuel generation unit depends on the scale. “Usually for a 1 ton/day plant, an investment of Rs. 15-20 lakhs is enough,” he further adds. Biogas comes with various benefits such as clean environment, energy production on site, and revenues from fertilizer and gas or electricity. The Government of India provides 40% subsidy to farmers using this technology. In the future, he plans to take voluntary retirement from the university and start a full-fledged company for executing biogas projects.
