The centre will provide research opportunities based on information on the countryâ€™s population size, composition, living conditions, social and cultural aspects. While census data includes important summary indicators and tables, massive data at the unit level has potential for in-depth analysis of social, economic and demographic conditions of the countryâ€™s population.   In order to allow the use of this data, it was proposed by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner to allow researchers access to micro-data at designated centres without revealing the identities of the population surveyed. JNU Vice-Chancellor S.K.Sopory said the centre will be able to provide all data related to census and population in the country for use by students and researchers. Located in the JNU Convention Centre, the facility will be open to students and researchers from universities and colleges and research institutions in India from May 14. It will be inaugurated by Sopory and C.Chandramouli, Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. The Centre stores all the tables from the 1991 and 2001 Censuses, and the tables from the 2011 Census released so far. A Steering Committee will observe the functioning of the centre.â€�   Naveed Iqbal, The Indian Express, New Delhi 10th May 2012   Census data centre in JNU soon NEW DELHI, 8TH MAY: â€œSoon, a census data centre will be coming up at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus.
