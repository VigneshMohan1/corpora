With the global environmental community mean gaining the upper hand, to solve the fundamental problem of environmental pollution, power plant desulfurization is particularly urgent and important. mobile crushing plant desulfurization environmental protection has always been a major event, but also a lot of desulfurization methods, mainly limestone / lime - a variety of methods plaster, spray drying, spray calcium furnace humidifier after furnace activation method, such as flue gas CFB . All along, calcium FGD desulphurization plants are the most widely used, it is through the limestone ground into a fine powder, as an additive coal, pulverized coal by high-temperature sulfur element in a chemical reaction, thereby reducing sulfur emissions into the air, reduce environmental pollution. Fineness calcium limestone FGD requirements, whether it is the manufacturers to buy limestone or limestone shipped to factories, dry ground through a certain fineness of limestone, which are related to the degree of finely ground limestone. Vico Heavy production plant desulfurization special limestone mill, according to the different technical requirements, easy to adjust the particle size and fineness of the finished product, in the case of feed size 300-400mm once into powder fineness adjustable . Has a large output, pollution and other advantages. Calcium FGD Vico Heavy mill manufacturers in response to the country's environmental requirements, exclusive introduction of foreign advanced grinding technology, in one fell swoop launched the world's most advanced power plant, steel mill blast furnace desulfurization system --- Q5 enhanced Mill machine, the machine's launch of similar equipment reversed the long-term dependence on imports of history, with Japan, Germany, United States, Finland and other countries about the environmental desulfurization equipment manufacturers and research institutes design matched achieved impressive export performance, and success used in large power plants. stone crushing plant: stone crushing plant,sand processing production line,mining production line Reply With Quote « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Posting Permissions You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts   BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On [VIDEO] code is On HTML code is Off Trackbacks are Off Pingbacks are Off Refbacks are On Forum Rules Contact Us AgricultureInformation.com Archive Top All times are GMT +5.5.
