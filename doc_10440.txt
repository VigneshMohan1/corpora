The company was started in 2012 at Ernakulam. Mr. Sudheer Kumar K.K, Ms. Leela Lakshmanan, Mr. Biju Menachery, Mr. Sooraj Sreedhar and Mr. Prince Jose are the founders. Farmers can partner with the company for either certified organic or non-certified organic products. “Farmers need to produce their organic certification for authenticity. For non-certified organic products produced through natural farming, farmers will have to produce the certificate from Krishi Bhavans,” Mr. Kumar clarifies. For non-certified products the company also visits the farm to confirm the claim. At present there are 4 organic producers and 12 farmer groups with around 150 farmers. The orders obtained are informed to farmers through telephone. “Farmers are grouped into societies and we inform societies,” shares Mr. Sudheer Kumar. Farmers make direct delivery to the customers and in some cases the company helps the farmers through logistics partners. Customers can pay through online or by cash on delivery or make advance purchases. Farmers are paid through continuous supply payment system that is 2 times per month or cash on delivery and for institutional supply it is also 2 times per month. “Now we are tied up only with 6 institutional buyers and connected with consumers’ weekend good food fest which we call good food challenge,” shares Mr. Kumar. ‘Good food challenge’ is a food event organized by the company to promote sustainable food system and to create the need of the good food system for good health. The event aims to convert a percentage of existing food purchases to support local food producers to support sustainable agriculture practices. When asked what steps the company takes to ensure farmers of price exploitation Mr. Kumar shares, “Farmers know the selling price of their products and we charge a minimal percentage.” Clarifying the details of activities at the company Mr. Kumar says that the company doesn’t handle re-packing but provides online and in-store platform for the products,“We assure only fair price and quality.” Giving example of price which farmers get by partnering with the company, he says, “Depending on the market price if the banana costs Rs. 60 in markets normally wholesalers pay around Rs. 20 only to farmers. Here they get around Rs. 40.” The target customers include institutional buyers and individuals customers. Institutional buyers are hotels, hospitals, college canteens etc. Food fest and social media are the primary means through which the company creates awareness among the consumers. At present the company operates at Kerala and Cochin with plans to operate in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi by April. There are 9 people and 3 technicians working at the company. Mr. Kumar shares the challenges face by the company as, “Sourcing the product and quality assurance.” The future plan of MChoose is ‘To conduct food fest in major cities and abroad and associations with farmer groups and group farming.’ Mr. Sudheer Kumar K.K has a degree in engineering.
