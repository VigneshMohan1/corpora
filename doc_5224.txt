Sweet Potato Sweet potato in flower in Hong Kong Sweet potato roots Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae (unranked): Angiosperms (unranked): Eudicots (unranked): Asterids Order: Solanales Family: Convolvulaceae Genus: Ipomoea Species: I. batatas Binomial name Ipomoea batatas ( L. ) Lam. The sweet potato ( Ipomoea batatas ) is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the family Convolvulaceae . Its large, starchy , sweet-tasting, tuberous roots are a root vegetable . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as greens . Ipomoea batatas is native to the tropical regions in America. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, I. batatas is the only crop plant of major importance—some others are used locally, but many are poisonous. The sweet potato is only distantly related to the potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) and does not belong to the nightshade family. The genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning glories , though that term is not usually extended to Ipomoea batatas . Some cultivars of Ipomoea batatas are grown as ornamental plants; the name tuberous morning glory may be used in a horticultural context. The plant is a herbaceous perennial vine , bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers . The edible tuberous root is long and tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato varieties with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.

[ 6 ] Although the soft, orange sweet potato is often called a "yam" in parts of North America, the sweet potato is botanically very distinct from a genuine yam ( Dioscorea ), which is native to Africa and Asia and belongs to the monocot family Dioscoreaceae . To add to the confusion, a different crop plant, the oca, Oxalis tuberosa (a species of wood sorrel), is called a "yam" in many parts of Polynesia , including New Zealand. To prevent confusion, the United States Department of Agriculture requires sweet potatoes to be labeled as "sweet potatoes" and not as "yams". [ 7 ] Origin, distribution and diversity [ edit ] Sweet potatoes in the field The origin and domestication of sweet potato is thought to be in either Central America or South America . [ 8 ] In Central America , sweet potatoes were domesticated at least 5,000 years ago. [ 9 ] In South America, Peruvian sweet potato remnants dating as far back as 8000 BC have been found. [ 10 ] One author postulated that the origin of I. batatas was between the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and the mouth of the Orinoco River in Venezuela . [ 11 ] The ' cultigen ' had most likely been spread by local people to the Caribbean and South America by 2500 BC. [ 12 ] Strong supporting evidence was provided that the geographical zone postulated by Austin is the primary center of diversity. [ 11 ] The much lower molecular diversity found in Peru – Ecuador suggests this region should be considered as secondary center of sweet potato diversity. The sweet potato was grown in Polynesia before western exploration. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia around 700 AD, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand from there. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] It is possible, however, that South Americans brought it to the Pacific, although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South Americans . The theory that the plant could spread by floating seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another point is that the sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated Ipomoea batatas , which is generally spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds. [ 15 ] Sweet potato tubers with different skin colors, on sale in Indonesia. Locally these are known as ubi jalar ( creeping yam ). Sweet potatoes are cultivated throughout tropical and warm temperate regions wherever there is sufficient water to support their growth. [ 16 ] Due to a major crop failure, sweet potatoes were introduced to Fujian province of China in about 1594 from Luzon . The growing of sweet potatoes was encouraged by the Governor Chin Hsüeh-tseng (Jin Xuezeng). [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Sweet potatoes were introduced as a food crop in Japan, and by 1735 was planted in Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune 's private garden. [ 19 ] It was also introduced to Korea in 1764. [ 20 ] Sweet potatoes became popular very early in the islands of the Pacific Ocean , spreading from Polynesia to Japan and the Philippines. One reason [ original research? ] is that they were a reliable crop in cases of crop failure of other staple foods because of typhoon flooding. They are featured in many favorite dishes in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other island nations. Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and some other Asian countries are also large sweet potato growers. Sweet potato, also known as kelang in Tulu is part of Udupi cuisine . Uganda (the second largest grower after China), Rwanda, and some other African countries also grow a large crop which is an important part of their peoples' diets. The New World , the original home of the sweet potato, grows less than three percent (3%) of the world's supply. Europe has only a very small sweet potato production, mainly in Portugal . In the Caribbean, a variety of the sweet potato called the boniato is popular. The flesh of the boniato is cream-colored, unlike the more popular orange hue seen in other varieties. Boniatos are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but many people prefer their fluffier consistency and more delicate flavor. Sweet Potato Harvest. Sweet potatoes have been an important part of the diet in the United States for most of its history, especially in the Southeast. From the middle of the 20th century however they have become less popular. The average per capita consumption of sweet potatoes in the United States is only about 1.5–2 kg (3.3–4.4 lb) per year, down from 13 kg (29 lb) in 1920. Southerner Kent Wrench writes: "The Sweet Potato became associated with hard times in the minds of our ancestors and when they became affluent enough to change their menu, the potato was served less often." [ 21 ] Tubers of a sweet potato plant, partially exposed during harvesting Transgenicity [ edit ] A study published in 2015 by scientists from Ghent University and the International Potato Center found that the genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from Agrobacterium , with genes being actively expressed by the plants. The discovery of the transgenes was made while performing metagenomic analysis of the sweet potato genome for viral diseases . Transgenes were not observed in the sweet potato's closely related wild relatives, but were also found in more distantly related wild species. This observation makes cultivated sweet potatoes the first known example of a naturally transgenic food crop .

It grows best at an average temperature of 24 °C (75 °F), abundant sunshine and warm nights. Annual rainfalls of 750–1,000 mm (30–39 in) are considered most suitable, with a minimum of 500 mm (20 in) in the growing season. The crop is sensitive to drought at the tuber initiation stage 50–60 days after planting, and it is not tolerant to water-logging, as it may cause tuber rots and reduce growth of storage roots if aeration is poor. [ 25 ] The softer, orange-fleshed variety of sweet potato Naturalized sweet potato in the Philippines (locally known as camote ) Depending on the cultivar and conditions, tuberous roots mature in two to nine months. With care, early-maturing cultivars can be grown as an annual summer crop in temperate areas, such as the northern United States. Sweet potatoes rarely flower when the daylight is longer than 11 hours, as is normal outside of the tropics . They are mostly propagated by stem or root cuttings or by adventitious roots called "slips" that grow out from the tuberous roots during storage. True seeds are used for breeding only. They grow well in many farming conditions and have few natural enemies; pesticides are rarely needed. Sweet potatoes are grown on a variety of soils, but well-drained, light- and medium-textured soils with a pH range of 4.5-7.0 are more favorable for the plant. [ 2 ] They can be grown in poor soils with little fertilizer. However, sweet potatoes are very sensitive to aluminum toxicity and will die about six weeks after planting if lime is not applied at planting in this type of soil. [ 2 ] Because they are sown by vine cuttings rather than seeds, sweet potatoes are relatively easy to plant. Because the rapidly growing vines shade out weeds, little weeding is needed. A commonly used herbicide to rid the soil of any unwelcome plants that may interfere with growth is DCPA , also known as Dacthal. In the tropics, the crop can be maintained in the ground and harvested as needed for market or home consumption. In temperate regions, sweet potatoes are most often grown on larger farms and are harvested before first frosts. In the Southeastern United States, sweet potatoes are traditionally cured to improve storage , flavor, and nutrition, and to allow wounds on the periderm of the harvested root to heal. [ 21 ] Proper curing requires drying the freshly dug roots on the ground for two to three hours, then storage at 85–90 °F (29–32 °C) with 90 to 95% relative humidity from five to fourteen days. Cured sweet potatoes can keep for thirteen months when stored at 55–59 °F (13–15 °C) with >90% relative humidity . Colder temperatures injure the roots.

Source: USDA Nutrient Database Yields [ edit ] In 2010, the world average annual yield for sweet potato crop was 13.2 tonnes per hectare. The most productive farms of sweet potato breeds were in Senegal , where the nationwide average annual yield was 33.3 tonnes per hectare. [ 28 ] Yields as high as 80 metric tonnes per hectare have been reported from farms of Israel . [ 29 ] Diseases [ edit ] Main article: List of sweet potato diseases Production [ edit ] According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, world production in 2004 was 127 million tonnes. [ 30 ] The majority comes from China, with a production of 105 million tonnes from 49,000 km 2 . About half of the Chinese crop is used for livestock feed. [ 9 ] Per capita production is greatest in countries where sweet potatoes are a staple of human consumption, led by Papua New Guinea at about 500 kg [ 31 ] per person per year, the Solomon Islands at 160 kg, Burundi and Rwanda [ 32 ] at 130 kg and Uganda at 100 kg. About 20,000 tonnes of sweet potatoes are produced annually in New Zealand, where sweet potato is known by its Māori name, kūmara . It was a staple food for Māori before European contact. [ 33 ] In the U.S., North Carolina , the leading state in sweet potato production, provided 38.5% of the 2007 U.S. production of sweet potatoes. In 2007, California produced 23%, Louisiana 15.9%, and Mississippi 19% of the U.S. total. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Mississippi has about 150 farmers growing sweet potatoes on about 8,200 acres (30 km 2 ), contributing $19 million to the state's economy. Mississippi's top five sweet potato producing counties are Calhoun , Chickasaw , Pontotoc , Yalobusha , and Panola . The National Sweet Potato Festival is held annually the entire first week in November in Vardaman (Calhoun County), which proclaims itself as "The Sweet Potato Capital". Nutrient content [ edit ] Besides simple starches, raw sweet potatoes are rich in complex carbohydrates , dietary fiber and beta-carotene (a provitamin A carotenoid ), while having moderate contents of other micronutrients , including vitamin B5 , vitamin B 6 and manganese (right table).
