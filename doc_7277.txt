R.F.D. R.T.I.   The Regional Fodder Station, Kalyani (W.B) was set up in 1969 under Fourth-Five Year Plan to cater fodder development in the entire Dairy production region comprising states of West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Mizoram and Jharkhand. One of the main object for establishing this Regional Station was to bring down the time gap between Research and Extension agencies in the aspect of fodder development. This Regional Station would work as bridge between the Research and Extension work. The result of research work would flow without time lag and reach to the actual users i.e. the farmers. Thus a strong liaison is to be established between Research Institute and Agricultural Universities etc, in one hand and in other hand the State Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Forestry, Dairy development Board, Co-operative Dairies and other such organizations in sphere of augmenting the feed and fodder resources of the entire Eastern and North Eastern Region.                 Copyright © 2013, Regional Station For Forage Production & Demonstration , All Rights Reserved Powered By
