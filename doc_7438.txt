Year of Start                                :          1935 2.  Genesis                             Agricultural Research Station, Pattukkottai was started during the year 1935 to study the requirement of water for different crops of the new Cauvery delta area of Thanjavur district. Later on, during 1972 this station was converted into Multi Crop Experiment Station to cater the research needs on different crops grown in this locality. Then the station was brought under Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in 1981 and converted into a Seed Centre to produce breeder seeds in paddy, pulses and groundnut. The research activities on cropping systems were also taken up. The station was upgraded as Agricultural Research Station during 1986. In addition to breeder seed production of rice, pulses and groundnut, the research on various crops are in progress.  As per the Registrar’s Proceedings No.A6/3850/2012 dated 10.12.2012, the All India Coordinated Research Project on oil palm functioned at TRRI, Aduthurai is ordered to shift to ARS, Pattukkottai with effect from 10.12.2012.. 3.

Salient achievements and progress i. Crop improvement The oilpalm trials viz., GEN 8 and GEN 8C laid out under farmer’s holdings are being monitored and yield parameters of bunch of individual genotypes are being recorded at fortnightly interval. Oilpalm seedlings of GEN 8 D trial received from TRRI, Aduthurai has been planted and established well. Dura development programme in oilpalm Multi location trials were conducted in rice,     ii. Seed production ·          Breeder seed production is being undertaken in rice, pulses and groundnut and the target was achieved without any short fall. ·          Truthfully Labelled seed production of Blackgram and paddy   c. Austerity measures taken on the usage of stationary, fuel, telephone, electricity and labour   a)      The Communication to the Directorates and other Research Stations was mostly done through e-mail and the stationeries are used to the minimum. b)    The vehicle is used only for the important visits.  The fuel consumption is within the allotted quota. c)             The Telephone is used very restrictedly.  d)    Only in the needy electric points, lights and fans are used. The points are switched off whenever the persons go out. e)             Casual labourers are engaged only for specific operations.    d. Income generation for the past five years   S.
