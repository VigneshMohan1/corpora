Q: I purchased your business license today but I don't see any way to update so the watermark is either missing or replace with mine. What do I do? A: Free edition of Visual Lightbox doesn't allow you to remove our watermark. Register your Visual Lightbox application at first. Use reg. key from the license message you received after the purchase. After the registration you can remove watermarks. Open Gallery->Properties->Templates: Watermark. Click to disable this option or use your own watermark. Q: In previewing some of my own slides on the browser, I find the background (thumb nails visible) too busy and distracting.

A: Open Gallery->Properties->General and find "Slideshow delay" parameter. Set the time you need. Q:How can I add html code into the caption of dispayed images? A: You can use any html code inside your caption to highlight some text or add links. In VisualLightBox app select image and add html code in the caption for selected image.

A: You should start the gallery onClick: 1) Add the following function into the <head> tag: <script type="text/javascript"> function showLightBox() { Lightbox.start(document.getElementById('firstImage'));} </script> 2) Specify the onClick event for the image (or link): <a href="javascript:showLightBox()">Click to show VisuallightBox gallery</a> 3) Set the ID for any image in your gallery (id="firstImage"), for example add it to the first image: <a class="vlightbox1" href="data/images1/image1.jpg" title="Image1" id="firstImage"><img src="data/thumbnails1/image1.png" alt="Image1"></a> 4) Use 'display: none;' property for your gallery in engine\css\vlightbox1.css.
