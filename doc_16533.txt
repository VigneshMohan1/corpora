Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme in the present form can be traced to the Arabari experiment initiated by foresters in the state of West Bengal. This experiment provided a strong feedback for incorporation of the system in the National Forest Policy of 1988. In many locations people’s voluntary groups were engaged in protection of forests without any initiative from the Government. Subsequently, based on the experience, the process of institutionalizing people’s participation in forest protection and regeneration began. This type of collective endeavour in protection and management of forests through people’s involvement was later termed as Joint Forest Management. STRENGTHENING OF JFM Top As per the provisions of National Forest Policy 1988, the Government of India, vide letter NO.6.21/89-PP dated 1st June, 1990, outlined and conveyed to State Governments a framework for creating massive people’s movement through involvement of village committees for the protection, regeneration and development of degraded forest lands. This gave impetus to the participation of stakeholders in the management of degraded forests situated in the vicinity of villages. The joint forest management programme in the country is structured on the broad framework provided by the guidelines issued by the Ministry. So far, during the last ten years, 27 State Governments have adopted resolutions for implementing the JFM programme in their respective states. As on 15.8.2001, 14254845.95 ha of forests lands are being managed under JFM programme through 62890 committees. The JFM programme in the country was reviewed by Government of India from time to time in consultation with State Governments, NGO’s and other stakeholders in view of several emerging issues. In order to further strengthen the programme, the State Governments may take action on the following suggested lines. A) Legal backup to the JFM committees i)  At present, the JFM committees are being registered under different names in various States as per the provisions contained in the resolutions. Except in a few States where the committees are registered under the relevant acts in most of the states there is no legal back up for these committees. It is therefore, necessary that all the State Governments register the JFM or village committees under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 to provide them with legal back up. This may be completed by 31st March, 2000. Completion of such formation of existing JFM committees may please be reported to this Ministry.   ii) There are different nomenclatures for the JFM committees in different States. It would be better if these committees are known uniformly as JFM committees (JFMC) in all the states. Memorandum of Understanding, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for different work or areas should be separately assigned and signed between the State Governments and the committees. All adults of the village should be eligible to become members of the JFM Committees. B) Participation of women in the JFM programme: Considering the immense potential and genuine need for women’s participation in JFM programme, following guidelines are suggested for ensuring meaningful participation of women in JFM. i) Atleast 50% members of the JFM general body should be women. For the general body meeting, the presence of atleast 50% women members should be a prerequisit for holding the general body meeting. ii) Atleast 33% of the membership in the JFM Executive Committee/ Management Committee should be filled from amongst the women members. The quorum for holding meeting of such Executive/ Management Committee should be one-third of women executive members or a minimum of one whichever is more. One of the posts of office bearer i.e. President/ Vice-President/ Secretary should be filled by a women members of the Committee. C) Extension of JFM in good forest areas For better resource planning and collective management distance from the village and dependency on forests should be the main criteria for allowing JFM programme to operate. Therefore, JFM programme should cover both the degraded as well as good forests (except the protected area network). The microplan or treatment plan and memorandum on understanding should be different for degraded forests and good forests (crown density above 40%). In good forest areas, the JFM activities would concentrate on NTFP management and no alternation should be permitted in the basic silvicultural prescription prescribed in the Working Plan but to promote regeneration, development and sustainable harvesting of NTFP which can be given free or on concessional rates as per existing practice in degraded areas under JFM. The benefit sharing mechanism will also be different for the good forest areas. The JFM committees will be eligible for benefit sharing for timber, only if they have satisfactorily protected the good forests for a minimum period of at least 10 years and the sharing percentage should be kept limited to a maximum of 20% of the revenue from the final harvest. The felling of trees and harvesting of timber will be as per the provisions of the working plan. A certain percentage of revenue from final harvest should be ploughed back in the silviculture & management of the forests. The extent of good forest areas to be allowed will depend upon the number of village household and should be restricted to a maximum limit of 100 ha and generally limited to 2 km from the village boundary. For degraded forests also as far as possible JFM should be first concentrated on areas upto 5 km from the village boundary. The implementation of JFM in good forest areas shall be done in a phased manner on pilot basis. The pilot areas may be monitored closely for a few years and based on the feedback and success achieved the programme can be extended further in consultation with the Central Government. Before allowing the good forests on pilot basis, all the degraded forests of that locality should be covered simultaneously. D) Preparation of microplan in JFM areas: i ) In case of new working plans a JFM overlapping working circle should be provided to incorporate broad provisions for micro plans. To achieve this flexible guidelines should be evolved for preparation of local need based micro plans. For this purpose, the working plan officer will work in tandem with the territorial DFO and CF for finalisation of the prescriptions of the JFM overlapping working circle. The micro plans should be prepared by the Forest Officers and Village Forest Protection Committees after detailed PRA exercise and should reflect the consumption and livelihood needs of the local communities as well as provisions for meeting the same sustainably. It should utilize locally available knowledge as well as aim to strengthen the local institutions. It should also take into account marketing linkages for better return of NTFPs to the gatherers and should also reflect the needs of local industries/ markets. This should be done with due regards to the environmental functions and productive potentials of the forests and their carrying capacity as also their conservation and biodiversity values.   ii) In areas where the existing working plans are in force (till their revision in future), for incorporation of micro plans in the working plans, a special order may be issued by the PCCFs for implementation of the microplan. In these areas, micro plan should aim at ensuring a multi product and more NTFP oriented approach. Without changing the basic principles of silviculture, deviations may be approved in the existing working plans if necessary. To ensure this, the concerned DFO and CF should dovetail the requirements of micro plans with the working plans.   iii) The micro plan should also take into consideration and provide suitable advice for areas planted/ to be planted on community lands and other Government lands outside the notified forest areas including in the district council areas of North East.   iv) Infrastructure/ Ecodevelopment under micro plan should form a separate entity for funding it through concerned    development agencies. E) Conflict resolution In order to resolve conflicts in the functioning of JFM committees and to maintain harmony among different groups participating in the JFM, State Governments may constitute divisional and state level representative forums or working groups. This forum/ group should include representatives from all the stakeholders including NGOs. The model prescribed by the Andhra Pradesh Government for this purpose is a case in point for consideration. F) Recognition of Self-initiated groups The community groups in many places in Orissa, Bihar, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are performing the essential functions of forest protection and regeneration. These groups need to be identified, recognized and registered as JFM Committees after proper verification of records and enquiry. The period of their existence and duties performed for protection and regeneration should be suitable assessed and proper weightage given to them for deriving benefits under the JFM programme. G) Contribution for Regeneration of Resoruces: For long term sustainability of resources, it is essential that a mechanism is created for ploughing back a certain percentage of the revenue earned from final harvest. For this purpose, no less than 25% of the share of village community should be deposited in the village development fund for meeting the conservation and development from its share of such sales. There should be transparent mechanisms for computation of income for sharing the benefits between different stakeholders. H) Monitoring and Evaluation Concurrent monitoring of progress and performance of this programme should be undertaken at Division and State Level. Evaluation of the programme should be planned at an interval of 3 years and 5 years at Division and State level respectively. STATUS OF JFM PROGRAMME Top Government of India on June 1, 1990 issued guidelines to the state governments for involving local communities in the protection and development of the degraded forests. Based on this,the JFM programme has now been widely adopted in twenty two states of the country. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Nagaland, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. As per information received by the Ministry from the various State Governments as on 1.1.2000, there are 36130 JFM Committees managing 10,248,586.41 ha. of forests under the JFM programme in these 22 states of the country. The primary objective of JFM is to provide a visible role to the local communities in planning, management and protection of forests and to give them a share in the benefits from these forests. On operational parameters, JFM is a concept of developing partnership between forest department and fringe forest user groups on the basis of jointly defined roles and responsibilities. JFM in India is gradually emerging as a powerful tool of sustainable forestry. It recognises the livelihood and sustenance needs of the people through the principle of ‘care and share’. The concept of JFM has been interpretted in various ways but the basic element in this concept is to establish grass-root community based institutions for protection and management of the forests. The programme aims at empowering local people for their active participation as partner in the management of forest resources and sharing the benefits derived from its protection and management. The JFM approach optimises the returns, minimises conflicts and links the forestry development works with over all development of the land based resources. It also aims at acquiring technical and managerial capability available at the grassroot level. JOINT FOREST MANAGEMENT CELL Top The JFM programme has been growing at a different pace in different parts of the country and till now twenty two States have adopted resolutions. Though broadly having similar pattern, the resolutions at different States have their own peculiarity. Different type of mechanism has been adopted with regard to constitution of Joint Forest Management committees, usufructs sharing of benefits, gender issues, protection mechanism, roles & responsibilities of the committees and other related mechanism for the execution of this programme. It has been experienced that more stress is being laid on increasing the number of committees and in covering more area under the JFM programme without critically monitoring the success of the programme in larger context. To make JFM programme grow sustainably and to have a comparatively uniform policy in various parts of the country, it is necessary to have a system for continuous feed back on this programme. This matter was examined by the Government of India and to effectively monitor the impact of the JFM programme on protection and development of forests, a JFM Cell was created in August, 1988 in the Forest Protection Division of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. At present the activities of JFM Cell are being looked after by Dr. V.K. Bahuguna, Deputy Inspector General of Forests. ACHEIVEMENTS OF JFM CELL Top The main task of the cell is to effectively monitor the impact of the JFM programme being implemented by various State Governments on protection and development of forests. It has been a handicap to get true and reliable data on JFM programme. Most of the work on the subject, was being done by different agencies to publish case studies to highlight the success stories without having a systematic approach to study the programme. The JFM Cell in a short period of time since its inception has made numerous achievements. The main achievements are as under. 1.Review of JFM programme At the initiative of JFM Cell, a Standing Committee on Joint Forest   Management was constituted under the Chairmanship of eminent scientist Dr.T.N. Khoshoo, to advise the Ministry of Environment and Forests on various JFM matters. A copy of the notification for constitution of this committee is placed at Annexure-V. The tenure of the committee is for two years. Other members of the committee include senior government officials, representative from leading NGO’s, representative from educational institutions and other intellectuals from different fields of expertise. So far, six meeting of the committee has been organised and it has interacted with various State Government officials, leading NGO’s of the country and various donor agencies. Various aspects of JFM were discussed in details with these agencies and views were exchanged for review of the programme. The Committee has submitted its interim recommendations to the Government on the issues of (I) Implementation of microplans in JFM areas (ii) Extension of JFM on good forest area (iii) Participation of women in JFM programme. These recommendations have been accepted by the Government. 2.Coordination with State Governments To fill the communication gap between Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India and various state forest departments and for better coordination and sound policy decisions, the State Governments were asked to appoint JFM Nodal Officers in their states. So far 11 states have appointed JFM Nodal Officers in their states at the initiative of the JFM Cell. The list of JFM Nodal Officers is placed at Annexure-VI. In the month of October 1999, a meeting was held with all the JFM Nodal Officers and representatives of the State Governments. Various issues were discussed to strengthen the programme. A Committee of nodal officers has been appointed to prepare a format for the monitoring of the programme and to suggest ways and means for funding the JFM Programme. The report of the Committee is awaited. 3.Data Collection For the success of any programme and to steer it on the right track, foremost requiremnt is availability of correct data. The cell took up the issue with various State Governments and has collected and compiled information about the extent of JFM programme in various states of the country. Statewise area under JFM programme and the number of JFM committees in each state is under Annexure VII.  4.Ministry has also initiated a National Programme called Mantra 2000 which is being co-ordinated at nation level by Indian Institute of Bio-Social Research and Developmnet (IBRAD). Mantra 2000 is the symbolic representation of the concept Man and Nature : Trust, Relationship and Action. This is a collaborative effort of the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Govt. of India and six state governments - West Bengal, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Maharashtra and Gujrat. The details is under Mantra 2000. FUTURE STRATEGY Top In a period of about ten years, JFM programme has been widely accepted and well adopted all over the country. The area covered under JFM programme and the number of JFM committees have increased manifold. However, success of the programme mainly depends upon the commitment on the part of all the stake holders for the cause of forest protection and development. It has been observed that people are more responsive in the areas where there is scarcity of the biomass resource and where developmental activities have been linked with the JFM programme. Most of the publications on JFM are on a few success stories based on fragmentary research work and no significant efforts have been made to monitor the overall impact of JFM programme on protection and development of forests. Various issues as outlined in the National Forest Policy and which are linked to participatory management of forests such as enhancing productivity, limiting use of resource, damage from fires and illicit felling, grazing, encroachments and issue of financial support need immediate attention. These will be some of the future areas of the activities of the JFM Cell. The other areas in which JFM Cell proposes to work in future are impact of JFM on productivity, impact of JFM on natural & artificial regeneration, gender issues, relationship between JFM Committees and the panchayat, inter sectoral linkages, issue of equity, conflict resolution, sustainability of programme, employment generation, sharing of benefits and integrated rural development etc.., EXTENT OF AREA UNDER JFM PROGRAMME Top State No. of JFM Committee Area under JFM (in ha) No. of Families involved Total no of families involved in JFM SC ST General 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Andhra Pradesh 7606 1679084.00 244655 414650 659305 Arunachal Pradesh 13 5810.00 766 766 Assam 245 6970.00 3179 1495 4674 Bihar 296 504602.50 Na Chattisgarh 6412 3391305.31 76920 233585 161017 471522 Goa 26 13000.00 36 300 336 Gujarat 1237 138015.19 1124 101890 3495 106509 Harayana 471 65852.42 1612 0 7950 9562 Himanchal Pradesh 914 111247.20 9973 159 35098 45230 Jammu & Kashmir 1895 79546.00 Na Jharkhand 1379 430463.00 Na Karnataka 2620 185000.00 15800 9600 44200 69600 Kerela 32 4994.70 781 2841 3622 Madhya Pradesh 9203 4125837.00 177272 429307 259323 865902 Maharashtra 2153 686688.00 35877 41000 25626 102503 Manipur 58 10500.00 Na Mizoram 129 12740.00 Na Nagaland 55 150000.00 550 550 Orissa 12317 783467.00 Na Punjab 188 97193.40 4429 0 4973 9366 Rajasthan 3042 309336.00 55724 132133 84641 272498 Sikkim 158 600.00 669 835 1764 3268 Tamil Nadu 799 299389.00 43323 104497 147820 Tripura 160 23476.79 716 5804 1783 8303 Uttar Pradesh 502 45025.44 Na Uttaranchal 7435 606608.00 Na West Bengal 3545 488095.00 Na Total 62890 14254845.95 672090 1370279 738967 2781336              Total area covered under JFM programme in the country as on 1.1.2000 is 10,248,586.41 ha. And total number of JFM committees managing and protecting this area is 36130. The maximum number of JFM committees and area under JFM programme is in Madhya Pradesh (the number of JFM committees being 12038 and the area being 58 lakhs ha.). A chart depicting state wise percentage of total area under JFM to the total area under JFM in the country is depicted in Fig.I. Fig.II depicts percentage of area under JFM in each state to the total forest area in that state. (iv) Fresh guidelines on JFM: In view of various emerging issues, the JFM programme was reviewed with various State Government officials, leading NGOs from all over the country and other stakeholders and fresh guidelines have been issued to the State Governments on 21.2.2000 for strengthening of the JFM Programme. These guidelines have been issued regarding Legal backup to the JFM committees, Participation of women in the JFM programme, Extension of JFM in good forest areas, Preparation of microplan in JFM areas, Conflict resolution, Recognition of Self-initiated groups, Contribution for regeneration of resources. A copy of these guidelines is placed at Annexure-VII. (v) JFM Network: There has been a requirement to establish an institutional forum in the ministry to strengthen the JFM programme. The matter was considered and a JFM Network under the chairmanship of Inspector General of Forests & Special Secretary has been established in the ministry to act as a regular mechanism of consultation between various agencies engaged in JFM work in the country and to obtain a constant feedback from various stakeholders on JFM programme, for proper policy formulation and necessary suitable guidelines for the States. This network consists of Central and States Government officials, representatives of leading NGOs, donor agencies and premier forestry institutions of international fame. A copy of the notification for constitution of JFM network is placed at Annexure-VIII. LIST OF JFM NODAL OFFICERS Top S. No. Name State Designation Address & Telephone Nos.

Apart from undertaking primary survey in four states - Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, experiences, literature and documentation from all the 22 states implementing JFM in India were also consulted. The major findings of the study are : Institutional The most State governments are attempting to improve the socio-economic status of forest-dependant communities in order to reduce pressure on forests through integrating micro watershed development etc.  The VFCs across States vary in nomenclature, structure and composition. A number of self initiated groups are also involved in forest management.• In most States, the VFCs are registered with the FD, they are societies in Haryana and co-operatives in Gujarat. In Uttar Pradesh, VFCs have been characterized as Forest Officers under the Village Forests, under section 28 of the Indian Forest Act 1927• The functioning of the FD has undergone change in most States with the top-down planning and implementing approach being progressively replaced by the decentralized approach with emphasis on capacity building at the grassroots. • NGOs are increasingly getting involved with JFM. NGO involvement needs to be on a more continuous and sustained basis, which is however constrained by lack of implementation freedom owing to dependence on donors. • Currently JFM activities in different States are being funded from existing programmes of the FD, inter-departmental linkages, donor/external
