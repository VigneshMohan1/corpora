Sponsored Link Micropropagation.-Plant Tissue Culture Â  TISSUE CULTURE AND ITS HISTORY Plant tissue culture broadly refers to the cultivation in vitro of all plant parts, whether a single cell, a tissue or organ under aseptic conditions. Recent progress in the field of plant tissue culture made this area as one of the most dynamic and promising experimental biology. This new technique has enabled us to increase the knowledge in the following field of studies. Totipotency, nutrition, metabolism, division, differentiation and preservation of plant cells. Morphogenesis and plant regeneration from individual cells or tissues through the process namely organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis. Variations generated through in vitro culture. Evolution of haploids through anther and pollen culture including ovule culture. Wide hybridization programmes through ovul e, ovary and embryo cultures to overcome both prezygotic and postzygotic sterility mechanisms Micropropagation of plant materials In vitro selection of mutants tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses. In vitro culture and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Plant genetic engineering through in vitro culture methods and DNA transfer technique. Thus plant cell, tissue and organ culture permeates plant biotechnology and cements together its various aspects like Physiology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Cell Biology. Like other subjects, plant cell and tissue culture has its own origin and development. The chronology of major events in this field is presented for the benefit of the new entrants into this field. 1756- Duharmel du Monceau H. L discovered callus formation from the decorticated elm tree. This very old work was foreword for the discovery of plant tissue culture. 1839- Schwann, T.H expressed the view that each living cell of a multicellular organism would be capable of developing independently if provided with proper external conditions. 1853- Trecul. A performed experiments on callus formation by decorticated trees such as Robinia, Pawlonia and Ulmus. 1878- Vochting. H obtained very luxuriant callus from Brassica rapa and proposed the polarity in development of buds from the upper portion and roots or callus and from the lower portion of a stem piece. 1885- Roux, W.Z made the first experimental step in tissue culture when he removed a fragment of the neural plate of a chick embryo and cultivated in warm salt solution. 1893- Rechinger, C described callus formation on isolated stem fragments and root slices. 1901- Morgan, T.H coined the term totipotency to describe the capability of a cell to form an individual plant. 1902- Haberlandt, G published a paper on "Experiments on the culture of isolated plant cells: In that he says "I should like to point out the fact that, in my cultures, despite the conspicuous growth of the cells which frequently occurred, cell division was never observed. It will be the problem of future culture experiments to discover the condition under which isolated cells undergo division". He clearly set forth the purposes and potentialities of cell culture after having attempted and failed in the culture of isolated plant cells. The reasons for his failure may be (i) use of three monocotyledonous genera for much of his work, (ii) culture of mature differentiated green mesophyll and pallisade tissues, (iii) contamination during culture growth. 1907- Harrison , R.G devised methods of cultivating fragments of living nerve. 1910- Carrel, A was the first scientist who demonstrated the culture of living cells outside the body of an organism. 1922- Kotte, W succeeded in cultivating small root tips of pea and maize in various nutrients.

The history of plant tissue culture had its real beginning in 1934 when Gautheret tried to cultivate isolated cells and root tips on organised medium. The momentum from this pioneering work, a new turn in this ongoing research occurred, because of world war II. After the second world war, American plant pathologists became interested in plant tissue culture. As Steward (1970) pointed out, the plant tissue culture technique is another "Silent Revolution in Agriculture" having very good potentials to supplement conventional breeding approaches. Its potentials and prospects are discussed in subsequent chapters. The techniques' theoretical aspects and their applicabilities are simplified and presented. TISSUE CULTURE LABORATORY - REQUIREMENTS AND MAINTENANCE DESIGN OF THE LABORATORY The design of facilities for tissue culture research is a key topic in the broader subject of "Plant Cell Tissue and Organ Cultue." The requirements and design for a tissue culture laboratory are mainly governed by the research programme contemplated and also the great variety of fields in which tissue culture is applied. In general, there are certain basic essential facilities which must be introduced into any laboratory where the tissue cultures are to be used. The basic design of a tissue culture laboratory facility should have the following: i) Sterilization room, ii) Media preparation room, iii) Aseptic manipulation room and iv) Aseptic culture room Sterilization Room This should contain washer, driers, hot air ovens, and autoclaves. This room should have good ventilation. The following are the important items occupying the sterilization room. Large sinks with resistance to alkalies and acids and plentiful water supply. Large bench space for handling the glassware material. Hot air ovens for sterilizing washed glassware. Autoclaves for sterilizing media, solution, distilled water, culture vessels and inoculation equipments. In this, the position of the sink dictates the other arrangements. It is desirable to reserve an area near the sink for all preparative work. It is also better to have the hot air ovens and autoclaves near the preparation area. Media Preparation Room The media preparation room should be of convenient size with work benches for cleaning and packing the materials, sinks with water supply, drying racks, storage cup boards or racks for chemicals. This room should be provided with the following items: Freezers, refrigerators and BOD incubators for storing stock solutions, hormones and plant materials. Storage racks for chemicals and glassware. Hot plate-cum-magnetic stirrers for melting and mixing the media. pH meter for adjusting pH for the media and solutions. Double water distillation and deminieralization units. Balances, one to weigh small quantities (preferably an electronic balance) and the other to weigh comparatively larger quantities. Plastic carboys (l0-20 litres) to store high quality distilled water. Wire-mesh baskets to autoclave media and culture vessels. Glassware like glass bottles conical flasks, beaker, graduated pipettes, culture vessels etc. in different sizes. Filter membranes and their holders to filter sterilize the solutions. Hypodermic syringes to filter sterilize solutions. Aseptic Manipulation Room This facility be designed so as to have minimum of fixed furnishings with a controlled air circulatory system. All kinds of aseptic manipulations of the plant material should be done only in this room. The floor should preferably be of tiled or with polyvinyl chloride sheet for easy washing and quick drying. This room should be of fairly large size to accommodate the following equipments necessary for aseptic manipulations. The important equipments/instruments needed are: Laminar-Air flow chamber Spirit lamp or burners to flame instruments Atomizer, to spray spirit in the inoculation chamber Instrument stands, to keep sterilized instruments during aseptic manipulations Large forceps with blunt ends, for inoculation and subculture Forceps with fine tips Fine needles for dissections Scalpels and spatulas Cork borer for excising tissue cylinders of standard sizes Microscopes and their accessories Haemocytometer for cell counting Aseptic Culture Room The culture room should be contamination free with controlled temperature-light-humidity conditions. It should have shelves to keep the cultures. Several engineering aspects should be considered in designing a culture room to have a safety and convenient electrical system to have a continuous airflow for uniform temperature regulation, arrange the shelves in a proper way to have a contamination free environment. The following primary facilities are also essential to provide optimal environmental condition in a culture room. Provision for diffused light with intensity range of 5,000-l0,000 lux. Air-conditioners to maintain the temperature at 24 q 2xC. A humidifier to maintain humidity at or above 80 percent. Automatic timers to regulate the diurnal control of illumination. Steel racks to keep the cultures. A shaker for the culture of cell suspensions. Provision to maintain cultures in dark (as separate dark room or chambers). General Facilities The facilities so far described are essential for any tissue culture laboratory. The refinements or sophistications can be made depending on the nature of the research undertaken. The access to the scientific bulletins published by various scientific instruments/equipments and chemicals companies will give a fair idea about the needs for a tissue culture laboratory. The other best way to know about the needs of a laboratory for its layout and equipments is to visit an already established tissue culture laboratory. MAINTENANCE OF ASEPTIC CONDITIONS The most important aspect of tissue culture technique comprises the growth of tissues in aseptic conditions and the avoidance of contamination. Since tissue culture media are highly nutritious not only for plant tissues but also for bacteria and other kinds of microorganisms and fungi, contamination by these lower organisms should be prevented to facilitate proper culturing of plant tissues. Contamination of materials is prevented by sterilization and aseptic techniques. Sterilization Sterilization means removal of microorganisms already present. The removal of microorganisms may be from glassware and equipments, media and stock solutions and plant tissues themselves. Based on the nature of materials to be sterilized, the methods of sterilization can be divided into the following three categories. l. Heat sterilization 2. Filter sterilization and 3. Chemical sterilization Heat sterilization In this method, the microorganisms are physically destroyed either by dry heat or wet heat. Dry heat sterilization The glassware and metallic instruments which are not damaged by high temperature are sterilized by dry heat method. Mostly hot air ovens are used for this purpose. The normal recommendation of time and temperature for this dry heat method of sterilization are three hours duration and l60-l80xC respectively. Care must be taken to wash the glassware before sterilization either with detergents or potassium dichromate plus concentrated sulphuric acid mixture followed through washing with water. Wet heat sterilization This method is more efficient than the previous one, because of the high latent heat of steam. An autoclave or a domestic pressure cooker is used for this purpose. This method is useful to sterilize media solutions, distilled water and cotton plugs. Sterilization is done under a steam pressure of 20 pounds per square inch at a temperature of l2lxC for 20 minutes. To sterilize the empty glassware they should be wrapped or covered with aluminum foil or brown paper. Care must be taken during autoclaving of media since prolonged autoclaving or immediate release of pressure from the autoclave will cause decomposition of chemicals in the media. Filter sterilization Filter sterilization method is adopted to sterilize some of the thermolablile compounds viz: gibberellic acid, zeatin, urea and certain vitamains. These cannot be autoclaved with the rest of the medium. For this purpose, the bacterial proof membrane filters (millipore filters) are used. These filters can be fitted in l-l0 ml graduated syringes. After filtration, the solutions are added to the sterilized medium, before the medium solidifies. Different kinds of filters available are: (l) asbestos pads, (2) Kieselguher and porcellain filters and (3) sintered glass filters. The above mentioned filters have one or more disadvantages. Recently porous cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate filers are in use. These disposable filters possess a high rate of filtration and are non-toxic. Chemical sterilization Sterilization by using chemicals is practiced to sterilize the working area, including floorings, instruments used for aseptic manipulations and plant materials. The working area is generally surface sterilized with 70 per cent ethanol. This can be done either by swabbing or spraying the alcohol in the working area. The instruments like inoculation needles, scalpels, scissors and forceps are to be sterilized by dipping them in 70 per cent ethanol followed by flaming and cooling. Plant tissues do not generally harbour microorganisms internally, but the surfaces of plant parts carry a wide range of microbial contaminants. To remove them, tissues are surface sterilized with a variety of sterilants before inoculation into the medium. Generally, mercuric chloride (0.l per cent) and ethanol (70 per cent) are used. The plant materials are immersed in ethanol for 2 to 3 minutes, sterilized with 0.l per cent mercuric chloride for 10 to l5 minutes with constant agitation and finally washed 5 to 6 times with sterile distilled water. Antibiotics are incorporated into medium as chemical sterilants if the plant materials to be cultured harbour microbes internally. However, this is not usually ensuring asepsis, besides altering the growth and development of plant tissues in vitro. Table l. A list of commonly used surface sterilants and their effectiveness. Sterilizing agent Concentration* Duration Effectiveness Calcium hypoclorite 9-10 5-30 Very good Sodium hypoclorite 2 5-30 Very good Hydrogen peroxide 10-12 5-15 Good Bromine water 1-2 2-10 Satisfatory Silver nitrate 1 5-30 Good Mercuric chloride 0.1 2-10 Satisfactory Ethyl alcohol 70 2-3 Very good Antibiotics 4-50 mg/l 30-60 Fairly good * l to 7 in percentage, 8 in mg per litre.
