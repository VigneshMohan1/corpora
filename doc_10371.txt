Golden Agricare’s products are mostly sold in South India. Their products are also made available throughout the country online. “Lack of awareness about organic fertilizers in India is a great challenge and another problem is that farmers are fully addicted to chemical fertilizers,” shares Mr. Murtuza. The company has been successful in educating some rural farmers on the benefits of usage of organic products. Testimonial videos of a few such farmers are available on YouTube@goldenagricare account. Mr. Murtuza is of the opinion that unfair advantages taken by middle men should be stopped. He believes it is important for government to take a step in this regard. “According to me and my analysis, I feel that the organic fertilizers may reduce the cost of production. This may economically benefit the farmers but it will take some time” he further adds. Golden Agricare Traders plans to seek Government’s cooperation from the Agriculture Department. Some seminars and programs will also be conducted in certain villages in November. These seminars aim at receiving opinions of farmers regarding organic fertilizers and the farmers who have used the company’s products. Mr. Murtuza holds a diploma in journalism. After taking up cultivation of his land, his dream of developing the best for agriculture flourished. Since chemicals reduce fertility of soil and quality of crops, he preferred organic fertilizers and ended up venturing into his business that dealt with the same.
