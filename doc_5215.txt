Rice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Rice From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Rice (disambiguation) . A mixture of brown, white, and red indica rice, also containing wild rice , Zizania species Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or Oryza glaberrima (African rice). As a cereal grain , it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize , according to data of FAOSTAT 2012. [ 1 ] Oryza sativa with small wind pollinated flowers Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. [ 2 ] Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong , the legendary Emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. [ 3 ] Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,200–13,500 years ago [ 4 ] in the Pearl River valley region of China . [ 5 ] Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. [ 4 ] From East Asia, rice was spread to Southeast and South Asia. [ 5 ] Rice was introduced to Europe through Western Asia, and to the Americas through European colonization. Rice can come in many shapes, colours and sizes. Photo by the IRRI . There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally. In some areas such as the Far East or Spain, there is a preference for softer and stickier varieties. Rice, a monocot , is normally grown as an annual plant , although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. [ 6 ] The rice plant can grow to 1–1.8 m (3.3–5.9 ft) tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility. It has long, slender leaves 50–100 cm (20–39 in) long and 2–2.5 cm (0.79–0.98 in) broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50 cm (12–20 in) long. The edible seed is a grain ( caryopsis ) 5–12 mm (0.20–0.47 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) thick. Oryza sativa , commonly known as Asian rice Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide. The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin . While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. The name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera Zizania and Porteresia , both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of Oryza .

The Greek word is the source of all European words (cf. Welsh reis , German Reis , Lithuanian ryžiai , Serbo-Croatian riža , Polish ryż , Dutch rijst , Hungarian rizs , Romanian orez ). [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The origin of the Greek word is unclear. It is sometimes held to be from the Tamil word அரிசி ( arisi ), or rather Old Tamil arici . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] However, Krishnamurti [ 12 ] disagrees with the notion that Old Tamil arici is the source of the Greek term, and proposes that it was borrowed from descendants of Proto-Dravidian * wariñci instead. Mayrhofer [ 13 ] suggests that the immediate source of the Greek word is to be sought in Old Iranian words of the types * vrīz- or * vrinj- , but these are ultimately traced back to Indo-Aryan (as in Sanskrit vrīhí- ) and subsequently to Dravidian by Witzel and others. Cooking The varieties of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained. [ 14 ] The grains of long-grain rice (high in amylose ) tend to remain intact after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin ) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre , in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in amylopectin , known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed. [ 15 ] A stickier medium-grain rice is used for sushi ; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Short-grain rice is often used for rice pudding . Instant rice differs from parboiled rice in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and starch often are used in batters and breadings to increase crispiness. Preparation Milled to unmilled rice, from left to right, white rice ( Japanese rice ) , rice with germ , brown rice A: Rice with chaff B: Brown rice C: Rice with germ D: White rice with bran residue E: Musenmai (Japanese: 無洗米 ), "Polished and ready to boil rice", literally, non-wash rice (1): Chaff (2): Bran (3): Bran residue (4): Cereal germ (5): Endosperm Rice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess starch. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste. Rice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some varieties , soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours. Brown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate germination. This process, called germinated brown rice (GBR), [ 16 ] activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including gamma-aminobutyric acid to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations International Year of Rice . Processing Rice is cooked by boiling or steaming , and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water similar to the volume of rice. With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric rice cookers , popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example saffron rice or risotto ); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called pilaf in Iran and Afghanistan or biryani ( Dam-pukhtak ) in India and Pakistan. Dishes Main article: List of rice dishes In Arab cuisine , rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ( dolma ). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as Tabaristan , bread is made using rice flour. Medieval Islamic texts spoke of medical uses for the plant. [ 17 ] Rice may also be made into congee (also called rice porridge, fawrclaab, okayu, Xifan, jook, or rice gruel) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.

Source: USDA Nutrient Database Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%. [ 18 ] A detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors. It depends on the strain of rice, that is between white , brown , red , and black (or purple) varieties of rice – each prevalent in different parts of the world. It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption. [ 19 ] An illustrative comparison between white and brown rice of protein quality, mineral and vitamin quality, carbohydrate and fat quality suggests that neither is a complete nutrition source. Between the two, there is a significant difference in fiber content and minor differences in other nutrients. [ 20 ] Highly colored rice strains, such as black (purple) rice, derive their color from anthocyanins and tocols. Scientific studies suggest that these color pigments have antioxidant properties that may be useful to human health. In purple rice bran, hydrophilic antioxidants are in greater quantity and have higher free radical scavenging activity than lipophilic antioxidants. Anthocyanins and γ-tocols in purple rice are largely located in the inner portion of purple rice bran. [ 21 ] Comparative nutrition studies on red , black and white varieties of rice suggest that pigments in red and black rice varieties may offer nutritional benefits. Red or black rice consumption was found to reduce or retard the progression of atherosclerotic plaque development, induced by dietary cholesterol, in mammals. White rice consumption offered no similar benefits, which the study suggests may be due in part to a lack of antioxidants found in red and black varieties of rice. [ 22 ] Comparison of rice to other major staple foods The table below shows the nutrient content of major staple foods in a raw form. Raw grains, however, are not edible and can not be digested. These must be sprouted , or prepared and cooked for human consumption. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of raw form of these grains reported in this table.

[ 24 ] There is no safe level of arsenic, but, as of 2012, a limit of 10 parts per billion has been established in the United States for drinking water, twice the level of 5 parts per billion originally proposed by the EPA . Consumption of one serving of some varieties of rice gives more exposure to arsenic than consumption of 1 liter of water that contains 5 parts per billion arsenic; however, the amount of arsenic in rice varies widely with the greatest concentration in brown rice and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton; in the United States, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. [ 25 ] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is studying this issue, but has not established a limit. [ 26 ] China has set a limit of 150 ppb for arsenic in rice. [ 27 ] White rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, which account for 76 percent of American-produced rice had higher levels of arsenic than other regions of the world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils. [ 28 ] Jasmine rice from Thailand and Basmati rice from Pakistan and India contain the least arsenic among rice varieties in one study. [ 29 ] Bacillus cereus Cooked rice can contain
