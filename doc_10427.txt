Vijayaraghavan Lawrencedale Agroprocessing India (LEAF) was established in 2009, founded by P. Vijayaraghavan, R. Manoharan, K.P Nair, R. Balakrishnan & LK Narayanan. LEAF is an end to end supply chain business of fruits and vegetables. Procurement, processing, end to end cold chain service and marketing are its main activities. The turnover of this company is 8 crores. LEAF does not farm land directly. It mainly procures from marginal and small farmers who are associated with community farming program. LEAF makes sure their major criterion of quality is met by the farmers rendering products to them. It is also involved with community farming programs to ensure farmers are educated about the right farming methods to produce the best quality. “Our community farming program conduct regular contact programs in the villages and help them right from the selection of seed to harvest, make sure that our farmers are following good agricultural practices and their dependency of the chemical fertilizers, pesticides. The program helps them to reduce input cost, field wastages and ensures the quality of the produce. Ultimately farmers are happy to have better yield and income” shares Mr. Vijayaraghavan, one of the founders. LEAF handles root vegetables like carrots, potatoes and beetroot at the processing plant. They source exotic vegetables and fruits from the Nilgiris for supply. Tropical vegetables and fruits from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are also produced at its processing unit. These products are stamped under the brand name LEAF and sold in the southern states of Kerala, Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Setting it apart from most brands is the utmost care taken by LEAF in making sure the produce not just remains fresh but also retain its nutritional value. Their produce is hygienically washed, graded and packed in branded PP bags. These PP bags are manufactured using Italian technology to retain the freshness and nutrients of the vegetables for a longer period. “We have an end to end cold chain system which handles our products right from the farms to the door step of our customers which assures the quality of the products we supply” adds Mr. Vijayaraghavan. Despite such added advantage, LEAF does not believe in competition. “This industry requires many more players in the agro processing field to take care of the current agricultural production in India” Mr. Vijayaraghavan further explains. LEAF is currently present in four southern states and they wish to expand their operation to other parts of the country. They wish to increase their turnover by 15 crores next year. The long term goal is to make LEAF products available to households across India. Mr. Vijayaraghavan is an automobiles engineer and was engaged in property development & construction business before LEAF. Moving across villages engaged with earlier business, studying the states of the agricultural practices and postharvest handling he envisaged an opportunity of an agro- processing based business.
