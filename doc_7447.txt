Phone:04362267680 Soil and Water Management Research Institute, Kattuthottam, Thanjavur was established during 1972 under Agricultural Engineering wing of State Department of Agriculture and started the research work on standardizing irrigation techniques for several field crops with special emphasis on rice.    On the first of April 1981, this Institute was taken over by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University as one of sub centres for carrying out water management   research. The station is located 6 km from Thanjavur on the way to Nagapattinam (NH 67).   The latitude and longitude are 10 0 45’ N and 79 0 E respectively with the altitude (MSL) of 50 m.   The mean annual rainfall is 930 mm and the soil type is sandy loam with the pH of 6.9.   The extent of farm is 16 ha with net cultivable area of 14.8 ha.    The irrigation sources are two borewells and Cauvery Grand Anicut canal water through Neivasal Thenpathi A channel.   Mandate of the Station To meet out the research requirements of rice and rice fallow crops of the Cauvery New Delta Zone. To conduct water management research based on crop water demand, water saving techniques and improving efficiency of irrigation water. To identify and solve soil related constraints to increase the productivity of rice and rice fallow crops. ACTIVITIES Conducting field experiments at research station to find out the solution to the problems faced by farming community and developing new improved technologies. Conducting on farm trails at farmers field to disseminate and popularize the proven findings Production of breeder and foundation seeds of improved varieties of rice and pulses Conducting trainings for Agricultural Extension Workers and Farmers Offering diploma course in Agriculture   Front view of the office of the SWMRI                         Dr.V. RAVI, Professor and Head, SWMRI ACHIEVEMENTS   Research Output   Water management   In the Cauvery New Delta region, irrigation to the depth of 2.5-5.0 cm after the disappearance of ponded water recorded the highest rice grain yield besides saving of irrigation water to the considerable extent. In sandy soil under the Grand Anaicut Canal system maintenance of 5.0 cm constant water daily on the field recorded the highest rice yield. In clay soil under the Vennar river system near the coastal area topping to 10 cm once in 2 days recorded the highest rice yield. Irrigation to maize at IW/CPE ratio of 0.8 during 4-30 DAS and 61 DAS to 10 days prior to harvest with common irrigation during 31-60 DAS gave higher yield of 1042 kg/ha with 200 mm water. Irrigation to blackgram at IW/CPE ratio of 0.5 recorded maximum yield by consuming of 160 mm of water. Two irrigations in the pre flowering stage (including irrigation for sowing), four irrigations in the flowering and pod formation stages at IW/CPE ratio of 0.9 at an interval of 7-8 days and three irrigations at an interval of 12-13 days in the maturity stage has recorded the highest yield with an irrigation requirement of 360 mm water.   b. Cropping system   In canal irrigated area of new delta, groundnut - rice - black gram / sesame cropping sequence is the profitable cropping sequence. In Cauvery New Delta Zone to get more production and net income,   Drum Seeded Rice – rice – maize + black gram cropping sequence was the best alternate cropping system .         c. Organic Farming   Under organic farming system, application of recommended dose of 1/3 rd N through farm yard manure, 1/3 rd N through vermicompost, 1/3 rd N through neem cake + biofertilizers + PSB could be recommended for Maize ( kharif ) - Rice ( rabi ) - greengram (summer) cropping sequence for getting higher grain yield and net returns. This practice improved the soil organic carbon status and microbial load.   d. Plant Protection   IPDM module for Rice for Cauvery Delta Zone:   IPM module for Cauvery Delta Zone has been validated in 2005 and it has been recommended for adoption in management technologies in 2006.   Rice IPDM module for Cauvery Delta Zone   Seed treatment with P.fluroscens @ 10g/kg Seedling root dip with P. fluroscens   @ 2.5 kg / ha. Soil application at 30 DAS with P.fluroscens @ 2.5 kg /ha Uniform leveling and clean cultivation Provision of rogue spacing (one foot for every 8 feet) LCC based ‘N’ as neem coated area. Irrigation by means of alternate wetting and drying. Installation of light trap @ 1/5 ac. Release of egg parasitoid, Trichogramma japonicum @ 1 lakh/ ha on 30 and 37 DAT for stem borer . Release of egg parasitoid, T.chilonis @ 1 lakh / ha on 37, 44 and 51 DAT for leaf folder. Application of neem oil 3% or NSKE   5% at low pest load. Need based (ETL) application of pesticides. Rat control through erection of barn owl perches, Thanjavur rat traps (50 / ha) and poison baiting   II. Seed Production   A total of 193.2 tonnes of paddy and 13.97 tonnes of pulses seeds    were produced at this institute   and   distributed to the farmers, agricultural departments and other needy agencies since the year 2000.       III. Training   Trainings,   exhibition and field days were conducted to the farmers, agricultural department officials, NGOS and students on various technologies especially on SRI, SSNM, Seed production etc. Totally 141 training for 2175 participants and 85 field days were conducted since 2000.       Staff Members     Technical Staff   Sl.No Name Designation Field of Specialization Contact numbers and mail ID 1.
