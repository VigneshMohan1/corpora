Led by Ramdas J. Patil, R B Herbal Agro, in association with Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri (Maharashtra) is constantly working on the solution for the deadly disease that hit the cultivation of pomegranate in India in 2000–Bacterial Blight of Pomegranate. Ramdas J. Patil has taken various courses in New Delhi, Mumbai and Israel to help improve his knowledge in this agricultural endeavor. Included in his vast experience are fifteen years as a senior scientist in the private sector and serving as an esteemed member of the Board of Studies at Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri (Maharashtra). He has also served as the Technical Director to the Pomegranate Growers Association. He is now the CEO and R&D Chief at R.B. Herbal Agro. The Importance of Pomegranate Pomegranate is a fruit that is expensive even when it is in season. This is mainly because the fruit has many medicinal properties. “It is very much useful in controlling prostate gland cancer. It also contains a high amount of antioxidants, which reduces heart problems and aging. It also has the ability to produce estrogen in women,” Mr. Ramdas said about pomegranate. Details of the Disease At first, identifying the cause of the disease was difficult. Mr. Ramdas explained that the anatomy of the pomegranate made bacteria an unlikely problem initially. He said, “Pomegranate rind is rich with tannins, which are antibacterial in nature.”   However, according to Mr. Ramdas the disease was later identified as a bacterium known as “Xanthomonas Oxanopodpv Punicea”.  He continued on to explain the nature of the bacteria saying, “This bacteria can infect fruits, leaves and stems. Initially it appears as oily spots on leaves or fruits. It grows very fast, within 48 to 78 hours.” R.B. Herbal Agro also conducted studies to determine when the disease was most common. The incidences of the disease are less common in the winter season but increase during the rainy season. The most favorable condition for the growth of this bacteria is high humidity – more than 65 % RH and a temperature range of 28 to 320C. Controlling the Disease After extensive research and studies, R.B. Herbal Agro along with M.P.K.V. Rahuri have developed a solution for the disease. It is called Char Sutri Karyakram i.e. the “Four Point Program”: ü Cleanliness which will reduce inoculums ü Correct horticultural practices ü Fertilization through organic manure ü Scheduled sprays for disease control. Mr. Ramdas recommends the following spray: 1] Prophyalexin 3 Ml + Cop-E 0.4 Gm – Per litre of water 2] R. B. Bordo 2.5 Gm + Sulfer 2 Gm – Per litre of water 3] Prophyalexin 3 Ml + PMBS 2.5 Gm – Per litre of water 4] Xanthonashak 0.5 Gm + R. B. Bordo 2.5 Gm – Per litre of water 5] Pseudo-FL 5 2 Ml + 5 Litres of Milk – Per litre of water Mr. Ramdas explained additional research for better yield saying, “We have studied and gathered data on the role of potassium and nitrogen on Bacterial Blight. We also found that biofertilizer is a useful took to control bacterial blight.” Therefore, Mr. Ramdas recommends a suitable INM programme to have a higher yield without any incidence of the disease. Training and Advice for Farmers The knowledge that R.B. Herbal Agro gains is shared with pomegranate farmers via training programs – they have conducted over 300 training programs so far. According to Mr. Ramdas, farmers using the Four Point Program and correct biofertilizers are now enjoying good quality pomegranate.
