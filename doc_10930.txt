Located at Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh Solwin Power Solutions was established in February, 2011, with its head office in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Ravi Kiran is the Managing Director and he is also holding the position of CEO of the company. For industrial and agricultural segment — agriculture pumping, it manufactures AC pumping solution through solar starting from 1 HP to 100 HP that runs for around 25 years for 10 hours per day without any maintenance cost as there is no battery. It also offers solar power plants. The company has done about 10 megawatts of EPCS so far, and we have another 10 megawatts, all going on for the erection and maintenance of these power plants. These are the 3 different segments of the organization. The company has got technical collaborations with companies like Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Snider and INVT. It works closely with these companies. The company has established its network in some parts of Tamil Nadu, entire Andhra Pradesh and Northern Karnataka. The Hukkeri Rural Electric Co-operative Society from Hukkeri, Karnataka state, has approached the company after seeing the kind of installations it has done, and after a glimpse on the net. The Solwin Power Solutions had been awarded the contract of converting the existing pumps to solar pumps to certain extent, so that their load can come down and they can give better services. The contract was awarded recently, a week back, and by around 25th of January, 2013, one can see these plants running in Hukkeri. The work is already in progress. They want to setup these demo pieces, so that they can convert majority of these pumps to solar and reduce the load on BESCOM. In the same way in Andhra Pradesh also there is a scheme under APMIP (Andhra Pradesh Micro Irrigation Projects). This irrigation department also had approached Solwin Power Solutions and they are working towards converting the existing 3 HP and 5 HP motors that are running on electricity to solar, so that they can reduce the power load. Mr. Ravi Kiran is an Aeronautical Engineer (AMIE). He worked as a Flight Lieutenant in Indian Air force for 10 years. Later, he moved to the corporate segment. He worked as a Vice President for IBM, then as a Country Head for Dell Computers, and then he came out and started this segment. Mr. Ravi Kiran says, “Now with our plan in place, we are opening up our branches across India through dealer network, so that these solutions will be available in the tiniest possible village as well. They do not have to contact the head office. They can see our products in working condition. These products will be available in their nearby towns and villages, so that they can go and see these products in working condition because Indian mindset is still ‘touch and see, then buy.”’ “I would say that with the government policies we have with respect to subsidies to promote solar energy, the challenge today is, though the government is trying to promote these things, the policies are becoming a hindrance with respect to the time it takes to release the subsidies. We have to try and speed up the process so that people will be more than willing to adopt these new solutions,’’ adds Mr. Ravi.
