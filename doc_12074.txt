Groundwater tables are falling fast and forest cover is under threat. The inter-relationship and inter-dependencies among water, land, vegetation and animal resources determine the nature and kind of livelihood support systems particularly in rural areas.   Depletion of natural resource base and increased biomass demand for human and livestock population are major threats to livelihoods of the smallholder farmers from rain fed regions. The degeneration of natural resources, particularly in rainfed areas, is assuming alarming proportion.   Natural resource management is congruent with the concept of sustainable development, a scientific principle that forms the basis for sustainable global land management and environmental governance to conserve and preserve natural resources. Hence, Chetna Organics would emphasize on management of natural resources such as water, soil, plants and animals, with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations.   Towards this, Chetna Organics partnered with diverse agencies in Government and other development agencies such as Department of Rural Development, Agriculture, NABARD and NREGS to implement various Watershed and Natural Resource Management Programs to take up interventions.   Good practices demonstrated by Chetna Organics through the implementation of Indo-German Watershed Development Program, Western Orissa NREGS Consortium would be basis for taking up the interventions.     Thrust Areas Building Sustainable Institutions Integrated Farming Systems Natural Resources Management Improving Livelihood Options Value Chain Development Food Security and Nutrition Seed Sovereignty Gender Mainstreaming and Child Welfare Copyright © Chetna Organic.
