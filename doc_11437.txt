Biological method 1. Hirsch – Manniella spinicaudata is a rice root nematode      which controls most upland rice weeds 2. Azolla Remarks I. Substitution and preventive method: a) Stale seed bed technology b) Land preparation c) Water management WHEAT Critical period of  weed control 15 – 30 DAS Cultural method a) Hand Hoeing b) Inter cultivation c) Criss-cross sowing Chemical method 1. 2, 4D (1 – 1.5 kg ai/ha) 2. Mixture of Isoproturan (0.75 kg ai/ha) and     2, 4D (0.4 kg ai/ha) during 30- 35 DAS Remarks II. Complimentary weed control methods a) Cultivars b) Seedling age /planting method c) Fertilizer management d) Cropping system   SORGHUM Critical period of  weed control 21 – 42 DAS Cultural method Hoe and hand weed on the 10th day of transplanting if herbicides are not used. Hoe and weed between 30 - 35 days after transplanting and between 35 - 40 days for a direct sown crop Chemical method Apply the pre-emergence herbicide Atrazine 50 WP - 500 g/ha on 3 days after sowing as spray on the soil surface If pulse crop is to be raised as an inter-crop in sorghum do not use Atrazine. Remarks 1. Inclusion of cotton crop in the rotation MAIZE Critical period of  weed control Maize 2 to 6 Weeks Cultural method One hand weeding on 40-45 days after sowing Chemical method 1. Pre-emergence application of Atrazine (1-2 kg ai/ha) 2. Combined application of Alachlor (2 kg/ha) and atrazine      (1kg/ha) is more effective and have wider spectrum of       control GROUNDNUT Critical period of  weed control Upto 45 days Cultural method After 35 - 40 days one hand weeding may be given. Chemical method 1. Alachlor (1-5 kg/ha) – pre emergence application   SUNFLOWER Critical period of  weed control 4-6 weeks Cultural method Hoe and hand weed on the 15th and 30th day of sowing and remove the weeds. Allow the weeds to dry for 2 - 3 days in the case of irrigated and then give irrigation. Chemical method 1. Apply Fluchloralin at 2.0 l/ha before sowing and incorporate or apply as pre-emergence spray on 5 day after sowing followed by irrigation or apply Pendimethalin as pre-emergence spray 3 days after sowing. COTTON Critical period of  weed control First 45 days Cultural method One hand weeding on 45 DAS will keep weed free environment upto 60 DAS Hoe and hand weed between 18th to 20th day of sowing, if herbicide is not applied at the time of sowing Chemical method 1. Diuron (0.5 – 1.5 kg/ha), Monuron (1-1.5 kg/ha),     Fluchloralin (1-1.5 kg/ha) applied as preemergence/      preplanting PULSES Critical period of  weed control First 30-35 days Cultural method One hand weeding on 30 days after sowing gives weed free environment throughout the crop period If herbicides are not applied give two hand weedings on 15 and 30 days after sowing. Chemical method 1. Fluchloralin (1-1.5 kg/ha ), Pendimethalin (0.5-1.0 kg/ha) as Pre emergence (preplanting incorporation)  TOBACCO Critical period of  weed control First 9 weeks Chemical method 1. Fluchloralin (2-3 kg/ha), Pendemethalin (1-1.5 kg/ha) as     pre-emergence application SUGARCANE Critical period of  weed control 4 to 5 months Cultural method Remove the weeds along the furrows with hand hoe.  Mechanical method If herbicide is not applied work the junior-hoe along the ridges on 25, 55 and 85 days after planting for removal of weeds and proper stirring Chemical method 1. Pre-emergence herbicides like atrazine (2 to 3 kg/ha)      Simazine (2 to 3 kg/ha), Alachlor (1.3 to 2.5 kg/ha) etc.,      will generally last for 8 to 12 weeks 2. To obtain best results sequential application of       Preemergence and post emergence herbicides or post     emergence herbicides like Glyphosate (0.8 to 1.6 kg/ha)     Paraquat (0.4 to 0.8 kg/ha).   | Home | Seasons & Varieties | Tillage | Nutrient Management | Irrigation Management | Weed Management | Crop Protection | Cost of Cultivation | © All Rights Reserved.
