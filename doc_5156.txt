Manihot sprucei Pax Manihot utilissima Pohl Manihot esculenta , with common names cassava ( / k ə ˈ s ɑː v ə / ), [ 2 ] Brazilian arrowroot , [ 2 ] manioc , [ 2 ] and tapioca , [ 2 ] is a woody shrub of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae , native to South America . It is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root , a major source of carbohydrates . Though it is sometimes called yuca in Spanish, it differs from the yucca , an unrelated fruit-bearing shrub in the family Asparagaceae . Cassava, when dried to a powdery (or pearly) extract, is called tapioca ; its fermented, flaky version is named garri . Cassava is the third largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after rice and maize . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Cassava is a major staple food in the developing world, providing a basic diet for over half a billion people. [ 5 ] It is one of the most drought-tolerant crops, capable of growing on marginal soils. Nigeria is the world's largest producer of cassava, while Thailand is the largest exporter of dried cassava. Cassava is classified as either sweet or bitter. Like other roots and tubers, both bitter and sweet varieties of cassava contain antinutritional factors and toxins, with the bitter varieties containing much larger amounts. [ 6 ] They must be properly prepared before consumption, as improper preparation of cassava can leave enough residual cyanide to cause acute cyanide intoxication, goiters , and even ataxia or partial paralysis. [ 7 ] The more toxic varieties of cassava are a fall-back resource (a "food security crop") in times of famine in some places. [ 8 ] Farmers often prefer the bitter varieties because they deter pests, animals, and thieves.

Commercial varieties can be 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) in diameter at the top, and around 15 to 30 cm (5.9 to 11.8 in) long. A woody vascular bundle runs along the root's axis . The flesh can be chalk-white or yellowish. Cassava roots are very rich in starch and contain significant amounts of calcium (50 mg/100g), phosphorus (40 mg/100g) and vitamin C (25 mg/100g). However, they are poor in protein and other nutrients . In contrast, cassava leaves are a good source of protein (rich in lysine) but deficient in the amino acid methionine and possibly tryptophan . [ 10 ] Details of cassava plants Unprocessed roots Leaf Leaf detail Picked buds Seeds History [ edit ] Yuca in Moche culture, 100 AD, Larco Museum Collection Wild populations of M. esculenta subspecies flabellifolia , shown to be the progenitor of domesticated cassava, are centered in west-central Brazil, where it was likely first domesticated more than 10,000 years BP . [ 11 ] Forms of the modern domesticated species can also be found growing in the wild in the south of Brazil . By 4,600 BC, manioc pollen appears in the Gulf of Mexico lowlands, at the San Andrés archaeological site. [ 12 ] The oldest direct evidence of cassava cultivation comes from a 1,400-year-old Maya site, Joya de Cerén , in El Salvador . [ 13 ] With its high food potential, it had become a staple food of the native populations of northern South America, southern Mesoamerica, and the Caribbean by the time of the Spanish conquest. Its cultivation was continued by the colonial Portuguese and Spanish. Cassava was a staple food for pre-Columbian peoples in the Americas and is often portrayed in indigenous art . The Moche people often depicted yuca in their ceramics. [ 14 ] Cassava was introduced to Africa by Portuguese traders from Brazil in the 16th century. Maize and cassava are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops. [ 15 ] Cassava is sometimes described as the 'bread of the tropics' [ 16 ] but should not be confused with the tropical and equatorial bread tree (Encephalartos) , the breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) or the African breadfruit (Treculia africana) . Economic importance [ edit ] A cross section of cassava World production of cassava root was estimated to be 184 million tonnes in 2002, rising to 230 million tonnes in 2008. [ 17 ] The majority of production in 2002 was in Africa , where 99.1 million tonnes were grown; 51.5 million tonnes were grown in Asia ; and 33.2 million tonnes in Latin America and the Caribbean . Nigeria is the world's largest producer of cassava. However, based on the statistics from the FAO of the United Nations , Thailand is the largest exporting country of dried cassava, with a total of 77% of world export in 2005. The second largest exporting country is Vietnam , with 13.6%, followed by Indonesia (5.8%) and Costa Rica (2.1%). Worldwide cassava production increased by 12.5% between 1988 and 1990. [ citation needed ] In 2010, the average yield of cassava crops worldwide was 12.5 tonnes per hectare. The most productive cassava farms in the world were in India , with a nationwide average yield of 34.8 tonnes per hectare in 2010. [ 18 ] Cassava, yams ( Dioscorea spp.) and sweet potatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ) are important sources of food in the tropics. The cassava plant gives the third highest yield of carbohydrates per cultivated area among crop plants, after sugarcane and sugar beets . [ 19 ] Cassava plays a particularly important role in agriculture in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, because it does well on poor soils and with low rainfall, and because it is a perennial that can be harvested as required. Its wide harvesting window allows it to act as a famine reserve and is invaluable in managing labor schedules. It offers flexibility to resource-poor farmers because it serves as either a subsistence or a cash crop. [ 20 ] Cassava in cultivation in Democratic Republic of Congo No continent depends as much on root and tuber crops in feeding its population as does Africa. In the humid and subhumid areas of tropical Africa, it is either a primary staple food or a secondary costaple. In Ghana , for example, cassava and yams occupy an important position the agricultural economy and contribute about 46% of the agricultural gross domestic product. Cassava accounts for a daily caloric intake of 30% in Ghana and is grown by nearly every farming family. The importance of cassava to many Africans is epitomised in the Ewe (a language spoken in Ghana, Togo and Benin ) name for the plant, agbeli , meaning "there is life". The price of cassava has risen significantly in the last half decade, and lower-income people have turned to other carbohydrate-rich foods, such as rice. [ citation needed ] In Tamil Nadu , India , the National Highway 68 between Thalaivasal and Attur has many cassava processing factories alongside it—indicating a local abundance. Cassava is widely cultivated and eaten as a staple food in Andhra Pradesh and in Kerala besides being commonly cultivated and popular in Assam where it is an important source of carbohydrates specially for natives of hilly areas. In the subtropical region of southern China , cassava is the fifth-largest crop in term of production, after rice , sweet potato , sugar cane and maize . China is also the largest export market for cassava produced in Vietnam and Thailand. Over 60% of cassava production in China is concentrated in a single province, Guangxi , averaging over 7 million tonnes annually. Uses [ edit ] Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] Main article: Alcoholic beverage § Beverages by type Alcoholic beverages made from cassava include Cauim and tiquira (Brazil), kasiri (Sub-Saharan Africa), Impala (Mozambique) masato (Peruvian Amazonia chicha ), parakari or kari (Guyana), nihamanchi (South America) aka nijimanche (Ecuador and Peru), ö döi (chicha de yuca, Ngäbe-Bugle, Panama), sakurá (Brazil, Surinam). Culinary [ edit ] Main article: Cassava-based dishes Cassava heavy cake Cassava-based dishes are widely consumed wherever the plant is cultivated; some have regional, national, or ethnic importance. [ 21 ] Cassava must be cooked properly to detoxify it before it is eaten. Cassava can be cooked in many ways. The soft-boiled root of the sweet variety has a delicate flavor and can replace boiled potatoes in many uses: as an accompaniment for meat dishes or made into purées , dumplings , soups , stews, gravies, etc. This plant is used in cholent in some households, as well. Deep fried (after boiling or steaming), it can replace fried potatoes, bringing a distinctive flavor. It can be made into a flour that is used in breads, cakes and cookies. In Brazil, detoxified manioc is ground and cooked to a dry, often hard or crunchy meal known as farinha which is used as a condiment, toasted in butter, or eaten alone as a side dish. Nutritional profile [ edit ] Processing cassava starch into cassava noodles, Kampong Cham. Cassava root is essentially a carbohydrate source. [ 22 ] Its composition shows 60–65 percent moisture, 20–31 percent carbohydrate, 1–2 percent crude protein and a comparatively low content of vitamins and minerals. However, the roots are rich in calcium and vitamin C and contain a nutritionally significant quantity of thiamine, riboflavin and nicotinic acid. Cassava starch contains 70 percent amylopectin and 20 percent amylose . Cooked cassava starch has a digestibility of over 75 percent. Cassava root is a poor source of protein. Despite the very low quantity, the quality of cassava root protein is fairly good in terms of essential amino acids. Methionine, cysteine and cystine are, however, limiting amino acids in cassava root. Cassava is attractive as nutrition source in certain ecosystems because cassava is one of the most drought-tolerant crops, can be successfully grown on marginal soils, and gives reasonable yields where many other crops do not grow well. Cassava is well adapted within latitudes 30° north and south of the equator, at elevations between sea level and 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above sea level, in equatorial temperatures, with rainfalls of 50 millimeters to 5 m (16 ft) annually, and to poor soils with a pH ranging from acidic to alkaline. These conditions are common in certain parts of Africa and South America. Cassava is a highly productive crop in terms of food calories produced per unit land area per unit of time, significantly higher than other staple crops. Cassava can produce food calories at rates exceeding 250,000 cal/hectare/day compared with 176,000 for rice, 110,000 for wheat, and 200,000 for maize (corn). Cassava, like other foods, also has antinutritional and toxic factors. Of particular concern are the cyanogenic glucosides of cassava ( linamarin and lotaustralin ). These, on hydrolysis, release hydrocyanic acid (HCN) . The presence of cyanide in cassava is of concern for human and for animal consumption. The concentration of these antinutritional and unsafe glycosides varies considerably between varieties and also with climatic and cultural conditions. Selection of cassava species to be grown, therefore, is quite important. Once harvested, bitter cassava must be treated and prepared properly prior to human or animal consumption, while sweet cassava can be used after simple boiling. Comparison with other major staple foods [ edit ] The following table shows the nutrient content of cassava and compares it with major staple foods in a raw form. Raw forms of these staples, however, are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked as appropriate for human consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and antinutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of raw form of these grains reported in this table. The nutrition value for each staple food in cooked form depends on the cooking method (boiling, baking, steaming, frying, etc.). The table shows that cassava is a good energy source, but like potato, cassava's protein and essential nutrients density is lower than other staple foods.

Under the Development Plan for Renewable Energy in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan in the People's Republic of China , the target is to increase the application of ethanol fuel by nongrain feedstock to 2 million tonnes, and that of biodiesel to 200 thousand tonnes by 2010. This will be equivalent to a substitute of 10 million tonnes of petroleum. As a result, cassava (tapioca) chips have gradually become a major source for ethanol production. [ 24 ] On December 22, 2007, the largest cassava ethanol fuel production facility was completed in Beihai , with annual output of 200 thousand tons, which would need an average of 1.5 million tons of cassava. [ 25 ] In November 2008, China-based Hainan Yedao Group reportedly invested $51.5m (£31.8m) in a new biofuel facility that is expected to produce 33 million US gallons (120,000 m 3 ) a year of bioethanol from cassava plants.
