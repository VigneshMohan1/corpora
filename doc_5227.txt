The continent/region-topic templates allow quick creation of navigational template for groups of articles about a common topic in different countries of a continent/region. It uses Template:Navbox to create the navigation box. The lists of countries included in the "Continent topic" templates are broadly those found in the "Countries of" templates. Discussions on which countries to include are best conducted on the talk pages of these latter templates. For example, Oceania generally includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific and islands in the Pacific Ocean that have closer ties to Asia or the Americas are usually grouped accordingly. Usage 1st parameter ( prefix ) The most basic usage of template is with a single unnamed parameter in the format {{ Continent/region topic | Topic [of/in]}} , replacing Continent/region with the name of a continent or region and Topic with the name of a topic followed by "of" or "in". For example, {{Africa topic |Geography of}} generates a navigation box titled "Geography of Africa" with a list of country names linked to articles such as Geography of Angola , etc. Code {{Africa topic |Geography of}} Result v t e Geography of Africa Sovereign states Algeria Angola Benin Botswana Burkina Faso Burundi Cameroon Cape Verde Central African Republic Chad Comoros Democratic Republic of the Congo Republic of the Congo Djibouti Egypt Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Ethiopia Gabon The Gambia Ghana Guinea Guinea-Bissau Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) Kenya Lesotho Liberia Libya Madagascar Malawi Mali Mauritania Mauritius Morocco Mozambique Namibia Niger Nigeria Rwanda São Tomé and Príncipe Senegal Seychelles Sierra Leone Somalia South Africa South Sudan Sudan Swaziland Tanzania Togo Tunisia Uganda Zambia Zimbabwe States with limited recognition Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Somaliland Dependencies and other territories Mayotte  / Réunion   (France) Saint Helena  / Ascension Island  / Tristan da Cunha   (United Kingdom) Western Sahara The named parameter prefix can be used in place of the unnamed 1st parameter.
