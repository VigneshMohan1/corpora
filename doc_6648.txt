From the cutting of the umbilical cord to the mats that have wrapped the dead for burial, Bamboo has been integral to the life of the Nagas. It continues to play a predominant role in the life of the people even today in every walk of life that ranges from agricultural tools and implements to shelter, food, and livelihood. Bamboo, the fastest growing and highest yielding renewable natural resource, and found extensively all over the State, constitute one of the most important resources of Nagaland which has to be put to use in the present day context for the benefit, growth and development of the people. REALISATION Denudation of forest cover, degradation of environment and fast deteriorating ecology threatens the very existence of man and animal. The development of the natural bamboo resources of Nagaland will greatly add to the environment and the ecological balance of the land consequently having great impact on the quality of life of the people. IMPLEMENTATION A planned, scientific and holistic approach to the cultivation and management of bamboos on a sustained basis can be an inexhaustible source of goods and services and can play a significant role in the development of the State. With increasing demand of timber and wood, which is becoming a scarce commodity in the world, bamboos can serve as an alternative to many of the forest products. Its wide range of uses and its great versatility qualifies it to be a multiple use alternative to timber which will add greatly to the rural agricultural economy in general and act as poverty alleviator for the rural poor in particular.
