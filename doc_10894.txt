Venkatrao Established in 2004 as a division of the Sadhan Group, Sadhan Exports has grown into its mother company’s partnership firm with an industrial engineering, agro and distillery division. With their operations primarily focused on fabrication, distribution and marketing, the company was founded by Mr. N. Venkatrao, who spent over two and a half decades in the pharmaceutical and service industry before endeavoring to start his own business. As Sadhan Exports’ managing partner, Mr. N. Venkatrao is a Bachelors of Science graduate with an Export Management Diploma. Products The Banana Fiber Extraction machine manufactured by the Sadhan Exports is the company’s main product. Mr. Venkatrao differentiated the two types of the Banana Fiber Extractor as single motor, single machines and single motor double machines. He said, “We can attach two machines to the same motor so that two machines’ work can be done at the same time. [hidepost] The main important things are the blades of the machine. When the fiber extracted [from the bananas contain water], the blades will rust if they are made of MS.” Sadhan Exports has adjusted the manufacturing of their blades to use SS material. Additionally, they have included a knob in the machine to maintain distance between the rollers and blades while the motor RPM can be tweaked. Demand and Competition Keeping their operations largely online, the company has not added marketing designations to their staff yet. In terms of the competition in their market however, Mr. Venkatrao acknowledges that it is tough, especially when potential buyers don’t want to spend too much money. “The main problem is cost cutting [by those who buy machines with] low quality MS blades, but we are not compromising on the quality. If the client is really serious about the quality of the machine, they will surely come to us only,” he expounded. Development and Markets At present, Sadhan Exports has a strong presence in the states of Assam, Mizoram, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Madhya, Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Although the company does hope to tap into potential markets like Kerala, the likelihood of this happening largely depends on the amount of website views and popularity in the states. In the mean time, the company looks to their research and development programs to enhance their market value. Mr. Venkatrao shared, “We are planning for Palmira Fiber Extractors and Coir Extractors.” Educating farmers on the benefits of their machinery and the proper use of the Banana Fiber Extractors is also on Mr. Venkatrao’s mind. Future Plans With an annual turnover of Rs. 4 crores, Sadhan Exports hopes to expand the company in the next five years. “Our main aim is to increase product range to other fibre extracting machines. We are also searching for reliable export potential countries as well as clients. Presently we have inquiries for exports but the reliability of the country as well as the client is uncertain many a times. That is why we are not concentrating much on exports. If we have assurance by advances and references, we will certainly export in the future,” said Mr. Venkatrao.
