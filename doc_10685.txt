This system can be use for variety of control strategies to operate ventilation fans. In climate control situations, the operation of the ventilation fans is coordinated with your heating system to maximize energy efficiency. For multi-fan applications, this system regulates the operation of fans based on the current calculated ventilating requirement. Fans can be operated individually or in groups to achieve varied ventilation rates. Each fan can be controlled using a simple off/on strategy, or with pulse width modulation (PWM). With PWM control, the control system regulates the on/off times as well as the numbers of fans operating to precisely match the current cooling or dehumidification requirements. This results in exceptional temperature control precision. Fan operation can also be coordinated with evaporative cooling pad(s) systems. For special applications, enhanced programs are available. These powerful, highly flexible programs allow you to easily specify the rules and conditions for fan operation that suit your requirements.
