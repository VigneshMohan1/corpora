Sugarcane intercropped with green manure and incorporated on 45 th day recorded increased yield of 10.8 t/ha. Mulching coir pith along ridges and furrows in tannery effluent polluted soils was found to be the best soil amendment for maximum cane yield. Irrigation at 50 % FC during tillering phase and growth phase and 25% FC during maturity phase recorded maximum cane and sugar yield. Addition of wild bhendi extract followed by lime was found to be eco-friendly and, the best clarificant in jaggery preparation. Sodium metasilicate spray at 12 Kg ha -1 at 6 th , 8 th and 10 th month enhanced ripening of cane. Spraying 2.5% Potassium chloride solution during summer was found to be effective in tiding over the drought. Raising of cowpea as intercrop on 3 rd day after plating of cane and incorporation on 60 th days was found effective to increase the cane yield in tannery effluent affected soils.   CROP PROTECTION Two rounds of spray with Muriate of Potash 2% on 40 th an 65 th days after planting in summer controlled the shoot borer in addition to save crop from the drought.   Neem cake 250 kg/ha or poultry manures 5 tons/ha applied at the time of planting in furrow were effective against shoot borer. Sugarcane sett rot caused by Ceratocystis paradoxa was effectively controlled by soaking the setts for 15 minutes with Carbendazim 0.05%+Teepal 0.1 %. The increase in the incidence of Grassy Shoot disease coincides with low temperature, high humidity and high rainfall. Sett treatment with Tricoderma harizianum + Azosprillum for 15 minutes gave good control against sett rot disease.     Dr.R.S.
