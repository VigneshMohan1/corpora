can be used as an ingredient for many fish, shellfish, meat, poultry, vegetable dishes, confectioneries, sweets, sherbaths, beverages and other type of preparations. Introduction Coconut milk is a product of the region of tropical climate and is in great demand in the culinary. CFTRI has developed a process for production of dehydrated coconut milk powder which retains the natural flavour and texture of coconut milk. It has good keeping quality & greater convenience. Process The process for the production of whole coconut milk powder consists of four major steps namely, extraction of coconut milk, formulation of the milk, homogenisation and spray drying. White endosperm of coconut after removal of shell and paring was passed through rotary wedge cutter. The coconut grating is expressed in a screw press to extract coconut milk. Then coconut milk is formulated by addition of necessary ingredients. This formulated coconut milk is pasteurized and homogenised and spray dried. TRADITIONAL FOODS Introduction The flavour of tradition is irrestible and so are the traditional foods. The intricacies of the recipe, the lack of opportunity to practice and master the art have tended to forego these delights to the gourmets and commons. Through modern food science and technology these traditions are now available with the added convenience. Use Ready mixes of snacks and sweets - such as Dosai, Idli, Vada, Gulab Jamun, Jilebi, Chakli, Maddur Vada, Pakoda. Instant traditions suchs as Puliogare, Sambar, Rasam, Pongal, Urd Bhath, Gojjavalakki. Process The raw materials are cleaned and roasted. The roasted materials are coarse grounded, sifted and mixed with other ingredients. The process will differ according to the type of final product. Cleaning, drying, ginding, size grading, cooking, dehydration, disinfestation, mixing, packing are the major unit operations involved in the preparation of traditional Indian foods. GRAVY MIXES Introduction The instant mixes are dehydrated products of complete ingredients (recipe) of the curry except the solid pieces of meat/fish or vegetables. The dehydrated instant gravy mix is reconstituted with water at the point of use as used as gravy or marinating mix as the case may be in the preparation of respective dish. Process CFTRI has developed process for production of dehydrated instant mixes for gravies (curry) of six types. - Gravies for meat preparations        - Madras Kurma  - Mutton Chilly fry - Gravy for fish preparations        - South Indian fish gravy  - Rohu masala  - Fish fry masala  - Goan fish curry - Multi - purpose gravy        - Meat - Chicken  - Vegetable  - Egg - Biriyani mix (mutton, chicken,vegetable) - Tandoori chicken marinating mix - Kabab mix (Ginger chicken kabab and lasone kabab)   INSTANT CAKE MIX Introduction Instant cake mix is premix containing all the ingredients normally used for the preparation of cake. Cakes could be easily prepared from such premix by adding a required quantity of water to the premix and mixing for a specified period of time and baking the batter in a baking oven. It adds variety to snack foods in the house hold. The advantage of the use of such mix is convenience as it eliminates the drudgery of purchasing ingredients in small quantities, weighing them and creaming them separately for a longer duration during the preparation of batter which is a very cumber some procedure. Market Potential In the developed countries, cake premix are extensively used at home as well as in bakeries as they offer technological convenience and varieties. In India, very little work has been done for the developed and popularization of such premixes, since bakery premixes are relatively new products, a market potential has to be created to be used as a house hold snack food item production of varieties of cake. Cake premix will also be useful for small bakery chains to prepare consistent quality products by preparing the mix at centralized place. Process -Dry ingredients -Sieving -Blending -Fumigation -Filling -Sealing -Storage SUGAR-FREE BISCUITS Introduction Ordinary "gluco" type biscuits contain about 450 calories and contain sugar up to 25%. The Sugar-free biscuits do not contain any added sugar. Replacement of sucrose became an area of importance in the late 1970s as a number of food industry professionals implicated sucrose in tooth decay, development of obesity, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, the development of diabetes etc. CFTRI developed and standardised a formulation for sugar free biscuit which can be used by diabetes. Process Sugar-free biscuits are made from soft dough based on the creaming method and processed in rotary moulder. The biscuits are baked in a continuous tunnel type oven as followed for sweet 'gluco" type biscuits. CFTRI has developed a special formula containing safe sweetness, which can give crisp texture and sweet taste to the final product. Nutritional Fact Protein : 6%            Fat: 10%         Carbohydrate: 45% FRUIT BARS (MANGO, APPLE, GUAVA, BANANA) Introduction Fruits can be preserved either in the fresh state or processed form. Fruit bar is a concentrated product with good nutritive value. It is very appealing and consumed readily as a confectionery product. It can be packed and sold in attractive pouches. The product is hygienic and has a good shelf life. Market potential Fruit bars are confectionery products and can find a good market in the urban as well as rural area for its taste, aroma and convenience in use. A dynamic marketing net work can boost of this product in India and abroad. CEREAL FLAKES -RICE Introduction Rice flakes are known by several names such as flaked Rice, Beaten rice, Aval, Avalakki, Poha and Chiwda. Rice flake is one of the many traditional products in India. With this background, the CFTRI developed a process for improved Rice flaking. The improved process has the advantage of increase in yield and better quality products, besides economic utilization of by-products. It is suitable for preparing soft-cooked (bath), toasted and seasoned mixture, energy weaning food, Tamarind bath, upma, sweet pongal, sweet gravy. Market Potential The market for flaked rice will predominantly consist at buyers from group especially of urban and semi-urban areas. Even the people of low-income group can also buy as the products are directly consumed along with jaggery and from coconut pieces by rural folk. Process The process for manufacturing the rice flakes involves following steps: FOR FURTHER DETAILS VISIT www.cftri.com TECHNOLOGIES IN IICPT   PRESERVATION AND STORAGE  1) High moisture paddy 2) Parboiled paddy during rainy season 3) Wet paddy straw 4) IPM of psocids   DRYING  1) MYDI 2) PPRC Dryer   PARBOILING  1) Prevention of off odour 2) Prevention of husk opening 3) Steamed rice 4) SST method of parboiling 5) Pressure parboiling 6) Sand parboiling 7) Thermic fluid parboiling 8) Parboiling of brown rice    MILLING  1) Modernization of huller mill 2) Low friction huller    PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT  1) Idli dry mix 2) Crispy mix 3) Continuous rice puffing equipment 4) Fortification of puffed rice 5) Rice vermicelli 6) Quick cooking sooji 7) Quick cooking rice    BYPRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT  1) Rick husk ash as carrier for bio-fertilizers 2) Husk stove 3) Bran stabilizer 4) Degermer   POLLUTION CONTROL  Effluent treatment plant for rice mills CONTACT US Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology (Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Govt. of India)  Pudukkottai Road,  Thanjavur 613 005 Phone   : 04362 - 226676 Fax      : 04362 - 227971 E-mail   :  iicpttnj@gmail.com FOR FURTHER DETAILS Visit us at :  http://www.iicpt.edu.in/   Home | About Us | Success Stories | Farmers Association | Publications | Contact Us © 2015 TNAU.
