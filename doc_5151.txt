Antioxidant - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Antioxidant From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Model of the antioxidant metabolite glutathione . The yellow sphere is the redox-active sulfur atom that provides antioxidant activity, while the red, blue, white, and dark grey spheres represent oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon atoms, respectively. An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state. Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals . In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions . When the chain reaction occurs in a cell , it can cause damage or death to the cell. Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often reducing agents such as thiols , ascorbic acid (vitamin C), or polyphenols . [ 1 ] Substituted phenols and derivatives of phenylenediamine are common antioxidants used to inhibit gum formation in gasoline (petrol). Although oxidation reactions are crucial for life, they can also be damaging; plants and animals maintain complex systems of multiple types of antioxidants, such as glutathione , vitamin C , vitamin A , and vitamin E as well as enzymes such as catalase , superoxide dismutase and various peroxidases . Insufficient levels of antioxidants, or inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes, cause oxidative stress and may damage or kill cells. Oxidative stress is damage to cell structure and cell function by overly reactive oxygen-containing molecules and chronic excessive inflammation. Oxidative stress seems to play a significant role in many human diseases, including cancers. The use of antioxidants in pharmacology is intensively studied, particularly as treatments for stroke and neurodegenerative diseases . For these reasons, oxidative stress can be considered to be both the cause and the consequence of some diseases. Antioxidants are widely used in dietary supplements and have been investigated for the prevention of diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease and even altitude sickness . [ 2 ] Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large clinical trials of antioxidant supplements including beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations suggest that supplementation has no effect on mortality or possibly increases it. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Randomized clinical trials of antioxidants including beta carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C and selenium have shown no effect on cancer risk or have increased cancer risk associated with supplementation. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Antioxidants also have many industrial uses, such as preservatives in food and cosmetics and to prevent the degradation of rubber and gasoline.

The evolution of angiosperm plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments – particularly during the Jurassic period – as chemical defences against reactive oxygen species that are byproducts of photosynthesis . [ 16 ] Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal corrosion , the vulcanization of rubber, and the polymerization of fuels in the fouling of internal combustion engines . [ 17 ] Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats , which is the cause of rancidity . [ 18 ] Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A , C , and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. [ 21 ] Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells. [ 22 ] Oxidative challenge in biology [ edit ] Further information: Oxidative stress The structure of the antioxidant vitamin ascorbic acid (vitamin C). A paradox in metabolism is that, while the vast majority of complex life on Earth requires oxygen for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species . [ 23 ] Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as DNA , proteins and lipids . [ 1 ] [ 24 ] In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell. [ 1 ] [ 23 ] However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as redox signaling . Thus, the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely, but instead to keep them at an optimum level. [ 25 ] The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O 2 − ). [ 26 ] The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction . [ 27 ] These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. [ 1 ] Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, [ 28 ] [ 29 ] while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation . [ 30 ] The use of oxygen as part of the process for generating metabolic energy produces reactive oxygen species. [ 31 ] In this process, the superoxide anion is produced as a by-product of several steps in the electron transport chain . [ 32 ] Particularly important is the reduction of coenzyme Q in complex III , since a highly reactive free radical is formed as an intermediate (Q · − ). This unstable intermediate can lead to electron "leakage", when electrons jump directly to oxygen and form the superoxide anion, instead of moving through the normal series of well-controlled reactions of the electron transport chain. [ 33 ] Peroxide is also produced from the oxidation of reduced flavoproteins , such as complex I . [ 34 ] However, although these enzymes can produce oxidants, the relative importance of the electron transfer chain to other processes that generate peroxide is unclear. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] In plants, algae , and cyanobacteria , reactive oxygen species are also produced during photosynthesis , [ 37 ] particularly under conditions of high light intensity . [ 38 ] This effect is partly offset by the involvement of carotenoids in photoinhibition , and in algae and cyanobacteria, by large amount of iodide and selenium , [ 39 ] which involves these antioxidants reacting with over-reduced forms of the photosynthetic reaction centres to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Metabolites [ edit ] Overview [ edit ] Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water ( hydrophilic ) or in lipids ( lipophilic ). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma , while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. [ 1 ] These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. [ 24 ] The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors . [ 42 ] The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. [ 24 ] The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts. [ 24 ] Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin . [ 36 ] Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients , but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below. Antioxidant metabolite Solubility Concentration in human serum (μM) [ 45 ] Concentration in liver tissue (μmol/kg) Ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) Water 50 – 60 [ 46 ] 260 (human) [ 47 ] Glutathione Water 4 [ 48 ] 6,400 (human) [ 47 ] Lipoic acid Water 0.1 – 0.7 [ 49 ] 4 – 5 (rat) [ 50 ] Uric acid Water 200 – 400 [ 51 ] 1,600 (human) [ 47 ] Carotenes Lipid β-carotene : 0.5 – 1 [ 52 ] retinol (vitamin A): 1 – 3 [ 53 ] 5 (human, total carotenoids) [ 54 ] α-Tocopherol (vitamin E) Lipid 10 – 40 [ 53 ] 50 (human) [ 47 ] Ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) Lipid 5 [ 55 ] 200 (human) [ 56 ] Uric acid [ edit ] Uric acid is by far the highest concentration antioxidant in human blood. Uric acid (UA) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase , and is an intermediate product of purine metabolism. [ 57 ] In almost all land animals, urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin , [ 58 ] but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that UA is not further broken down. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia. [ 63 ] In animal studies that investigate diseases facilitated by oxidative stress, introduction of UA both prevents the disease or reduces it, leading researchers to propose this is due to UA's antioxidant properties. [ 64 ] Studies of UA's antioxidant mechanism support this proposal. [ 65 ] With respect to multiple sclerosis, Gwen Scott explains the significance of uric acid as an antioxidant by proposing that "Serum UA levels are inversely associated with the incidence of MS in humans because MS patients have low serum UA levels and individuals with hyperuricemia (gout) rarely develop the disease. Moreover, the administration of UA is therapeutic in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS." [ 64 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] In sum, while the mechanism of UA as an antioxidant is well-supported, the claim that its levels affect MS risk is still controversial, [ 68 ] [ 69 ] and requires more research. Likewise, UA has the highest concentration of any blood antioxidant [ 51 ] and provides over half of the total antioxidant capacity of human serum. [ 70 ] Uric acid's antioxidant activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as superoxide , but does act against peroxynitrite , [ 71 ] peroxides , and hypochlorous acid . [ 57 ] Concerns over elevated UA's contribution to gout must be considered as one of many risk factors. [ 72 ] By itself, UA-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/L) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at UA supersaturation levels (535+ μmol/L). [ 73 ] Many of these aforementioned studies determined UA's antioxidant actions within normal physiological levels, [ 63 ] [ 71 ] and some found antioxidant activity at levels as high as 285 μmol/L. [ 74 ] Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) [ edit ] Ascorbic acid or " vitamin C " is a monosaccharide oxidation-reduction ( redox ) catalyst found in both animals and plants. As one of the enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by mutation during primate evolution , humans must obtain it from the diet; it is therefore a vitamin. [ 75 ] Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets. [ 76 ] Ascorbic acid is required for the conversion of the procollagen to collagen by oxidizing proline residues to hydroxyproline . In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins . [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. [ 79 ] In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme ascorbate peroxidase , a function that is particularly important in stress resistance in plants. [ 80 ] Ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20  millimolar in chloroplasts . [ 81 ] Glutathione [ edit ] The free radical mechanism of lipid peroxidation. Glutathione is a cysteine -containing peptide found in most forms of aerobic life. [ 82 ] It is not required in the diet and is instead synthesized in cells from its constituent amino acids . [ 83 ] Glutathione has antioxidant properties since the thiol group in its cysteine moiety is a reducing agent and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. In cells, glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme glutathione reductase and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems, such as ascorbate in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle , glutathione peroxidases and glutaredoxins , as well as reacting directly with oxidants. [ 77 ] Due to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell's redox state, glutathione is one of the most important cellular antioxidants. [ 82 ] In some organisms glutathione is replaced by other thiols, such as by mycothiol in the Actinomycetes , bacillithiol in some Gram-positive bacteria , [ 84 ] [ 85 ] or by trypanothione in the Kinetoplastids . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Melatonin [ edit ] Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant. [ 88 ] Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier . [ 89 ] Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling , which is the ability of a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation . Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant. [ 90 ] Tocopherols and tocotrienols (vitamin E) [ edit ] Vitamin E is the collective name for a set of eight related tocopherols and tocotrienols , which are fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant properties. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Of these, α-tocopherol has been most studied as it has the highest bioavailability , with the body preferentially absorbing and metabolising this form. [ 93 ] It has been claimed that the α-tocopherol form is the most important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. [ 91 ] [ 94 ] This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. [ 95 ] This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 )-deficient cells from cell death. [ 96 ] GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes. However, the roles and importance of the various forms of vitamin E are presently unclear, [ 97 ] [ 98 ] and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule , with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well-understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, [ 93 ] and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage. [ 101 ] Pro-oxidant activities [ edit ] Further information: Pro-oxidant Antioxidants that are reducing agents can also act as pro-oxidants. For example, vitamin C has antioxidant activity when it reduces oxidizing substances such as hydrogen peroxide, [ 102 ] however, it will also reduce metal ions that generate free radicals through the Fenton reaction . [ 103 ] [ 104 ] 2 Fe 3+ + Ascorbate → 2 Fe 2+ + Dehydroascorbate 2 Fe 2+ + 2 H 2 O 2 → 2 Fe 3+ + 2 OH · + 2 OH − The relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidants is an area of current research, but vitamin C, which exerts its effects as a vitamin by oxidizing polypeptides, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the human body. [ 103 ] [ 105 ] However, less data is available for other dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E, [ 106 ] or the polyphenols . [ 107 ] [ 108 ] Likewise, the pathogenesis of diseases involving hyperuricemia likely involve uric acid's direct and indirect pro-oxidant properties. That is, paradoxically, agents which are normally considered antioxidants can act as conditional pro-oxidants and actually increase oxidative stress. Besides ascorbate, medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as homocysteine . Typically, this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst. The potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above. Another example is the postulated role of homocysteine in atherosclerosis. Potential of antioxidant supplements to damage health [ edit ] Some antioxidant supplements may promote disease and increase mortality in humans. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). [ 110 ] Recent experimental evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case, and that such induction of
