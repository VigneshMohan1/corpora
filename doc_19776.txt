Nearly 80 percent of Cambodians live in rural areas, and 70 percent rely on agriculture, fisheries, and forestry for their livelihoods. One-fourth of Cambodians are food deprived, which means they eat less than the minimum daily requirement of calories.  USAID’s Feed the Future program supports the Cambodian government’s development strategy by increasing the country’s agricultural productivity, improving the well-being of the rural poor, and promoting sustainable management of the country’s rich natural resources. The overriding objective is to support Cambodia’s achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, including halving the proportion of people who suffer from malnutrition and achieving sustainable use of environmental resources. We are developing agricultural solutions to a variety of challenges, including poor agricultural productivity, postharvest losses, food safety, lack of market access, environmental degradation and the effects of climate change.    To do this, we are:  Introducing new technologies through demonstrations on “lead” farmers’ plots with associated supply chain development for quality inputs through local suppliers Providing regular and continuous technical assistance for two to three planting seasons in cooperation with local extension agents Multiplying our projects’ reach through client-farmer outreach to neighbors, and when clients graduate, the project then focuses on new “lead” farmers Strengthening the value chains through improvements in production, processing, postharvest, market access, and agriculture inputs.   Last updated: April 03, 2015 Share This Page News USAID Senior Coordinator for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Susan Markham Travels to Cambodia Civil society and private sector work toward profitable, responsible investment strategies Cambodian Entrepreneurs Learn Best Practices for Greater Competitiveness USAID and UNDP Collaborate to Boost Access to Climate Finance in Asia and the Pacific Landmark report on LGBT rights in Cambodia presents facts, experiences and recommendations View All Join Find out about career opportunities at USAID Act Learn how you can get involved and lend a hand.
