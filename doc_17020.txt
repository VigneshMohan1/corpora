CITIZEN'S CHARTER       The main objective of the exercise to issue the Citizen's Charter of an organisation is to improve the quality of public services. This is done by letting people know the mandate of the concerned Ministry/ Department/ Organisation, how one can get in touch with its officials, what to expect by way of services and how to seek a remedy if something goes wrong. The Citizen's Charter does not by itself create new legal rights, but it surely helps in enforcing existing rights. This website provides the details of Citizen's Charter of various Ministries/ Departments/ Organistions of the Government of India.   Sardar Patel Bhawan, Sansad Marg, New Delhi -110001 Contents of this site are provided by the concerned Ministry/Department/Organization.
