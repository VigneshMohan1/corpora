Free training for mushroom cultivation WANTED > Free training for mushroom cultivation I hail from Dehradun (Uttrakhand). My land is at Selaqui area of Dehradun (which is now a days has become an industrial area) so agriculture in coming future is going to be vanished. I am house wife with 2 kids (4 yrs and 16 months old), looking to start my own business of mushroom cultivation. I have done my Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Hotel Management. I have an experience of 10 years in hospitality industry but now being a mother, unable to look forward to hotels. Before I start mushroom cultivation, wanted to learn minute to minute details about necessary requirements related to soil, ph, temperature, composting, spawning, harvesting, storage etc. I know I can get all the details online too, but wanted to see or train myself practically, in order to get best quality of mushroom. Any other information you wanted to have, please do let me know. Looking forward for your response.
