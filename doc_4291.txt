The site also focuses on the current scenario of Business Infrastructure in India. Business Infrastructure forecasts an average construction industry real growth rate of 8.5% over 2006-2010. The Business Infrastructure sector witnessed some growth around 7% during April-August 2006 as compared to around 6% in the corresponding period the preceding year. The government of India has now opened this sector, and now allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI). This opening up of Indian infrastructure sector has facilitated the entry of foreign companies to enter the infrastructure sector in India. The key components of the key Business Infrastructure are - Transport like Roads, Airports, Railways, Utilities -like Power, Telecommunication , Water supply , Drainage, Sewerage, Solid waste disposal systems, Services. Commercial construction - like Accommodation, Restaurants, Recreational facilities, Shopping facilities, At present the largest project in the country is the Golden Quadrilateral , which is aimed to connect the four zones of India with world class four lane highways. The aforesaid project would cost around US$4.9bn and the most ambitious highway improvement scheme ever launched in India. The length of the highway would be 5,952km of road network. The real estate segment is the actual growth driving force of the infrastructure sector in India. Some remarkable developments are taking place in the hotel industry with several foreign players partnering with local developers to construct hotels, following a boom in the tourism industry. The challenge before the construction industry could retard the growth of the country. Although, FDI in the Business Infrastructure sector is allowed but it requires the government to introduce reforms, such as tax incentives for real estate development. Further, the issue of the money supply and exchange rate should be arrested and solved. The Business Infrastructure growth in India scores high on the IT Business Environment Ranking matrix. Moreover, India occupies the top position out of the 14 nations in the Association of South East Asian Nations region. The ongoing public-private partnerships and foreign collaborations in the Indian Business Infrastructure sector would further fuel growth and development of the infrastructure industry as a whole.
