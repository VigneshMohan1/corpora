The state has a 200-member legislative assembly with the fight heating up between the BJP and Congress. Amongst the prominent constituencies is Jaipur, which will have BJP's chief minister (CM) designate Vasundhara Raje, who was Rajasthan's first woman CM from 2003-2008, fighting it out. Other important constituencies are Dausa, Sriganaganagar, Bikaner, Chhitorgarh, while some probable candidates are Girija Vyas, Ghanshyam Tiwari, C.P. Joshi. Ashok Gehlot, the current CM belonging to the Congress is a challenger to Vasundhara Raje, but has only about 27 % support of the voters in the state for being the incumbent once again, although 55% voters are satisfied with his performance as per a recent pre-poll survey. The survey also suggests that the BJP is likely to get 115-125 of the seats while the Congress' existing tally is likely to dip to about 68 seats. The BJP has already cleared the names of candidates for 60 seats and is adding more to the list. The Namo factor may make the BJP lose out on the Muslim vote, while adding on other castes to its current support list. The main votes that can tilt the scales towards any party are from the Rajput, Jat, Gurjar, Meena, and Brahmin communities.
