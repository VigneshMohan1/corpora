Partnerships with a diverse group of institutions are crucial in addressing the risks and challenges facing the region; and in meeting the varied requirements for inclusive, environmentally-sustainable growth and regional integration. Partnerships mobilize resources (financial, human, and other), leverage knowledge, meet unique needs for highly specialized development projects, and make aid more effective throughout the region. Partnerships are central to planning, financing, and implementing ADB operations. ADB understands that knowledge is also an important driver to change. ADB's Knowledge Management Framework and Action Plan (2009-2011) identifies knowledge partnerships as one of the four pillars upon which the framework rests. Knowledge partnerships help ADB discover new ideas, enrich its knowledge on development, and share the learning it generates. Demand for concessional financing in Asia and the Pacific exceeds what the Asian Development Fund (ADF) can finance. ADB therefore adopts a system to fairly allocate ADF support among the many competing needs, and to direct the funds to where they will be used most effectively. Strategic Partnerships   Through its partnerships, ADB seeks to build voluntary collaborative agreements in which parties work together to achieve a common purpose or task, while sharing risks, responsibilities, resources, competencies, and benefits. This site presents ADB's formal strategic partnerships with international development agencies, multilateral and bilateral institutions, the private sector, nongovernment organizations and civil society, and foundations. ADB has also signed cofinancing agreements with various funding agencies, in an effort to maximize the impact of development assistance through coordination.
