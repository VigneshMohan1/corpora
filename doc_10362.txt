Go to the shop Ganga Kaveri Seeds Home Ganga Kaveri Seeds Hyderabad based seeds producer soon going to launch maize, cotton and paddy millet seeds Ramana Rao Ganga Kaveri Seeds Pvt. Ltd was started 40 years ago as an informal family business. Later on it was converted as a private limited company in 1983. It was established in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. They are one of the first to start seeds industry in the country dealing in bajra, cotton, jowar, maize, paddy, sorghum and sunflower. Now, the company has got a full-fledged research and development, production, processing, quality control, sales and marketing of seeds. Mr. Ramana Rao is the CEO of the company. Ganga Kaveri Seeds Private Limited was the brainchild of Mr. M. Narasimha Reddy, a progressive agriculturist in a small village ‘Maktha’ in Karimnagar district of Andhra Pradesh. He was the recipient of the ‘Krishi Pandit’ award by the Andhra Pradesh Government. He recognized the need for growing seeds to meet the farmer’s requirements and thus promoted a firm called “Ganga Kaveri Agricultural Farms’ in partnership with his eldest son Mr. M.V. Reddy. Ganga Kaveri started its seeds production work in association with Rockefeller Foundation and National Seed Corporation (India). It was in the late 70s the Ganga Kaveri Group ventured with its production processing distribution towards northern states of India with a production & distribution agreement with Pioneer Seeds of USA. During this period, Mr. Srikanth Reddy, a B.Sc., major in Agriculture and second son of Mr. M. Narasimha Reddy joined the company to strengthen the company. It ventured into northern states and started marketing seeds in Punjab, Haryana and parts of Rajasthan. When Pioneer Seeds decided to withdraw their license, the company started their own R & D and now it’s full-fledged company dealing in seeds. Thus Ganga Kaveri Seeds Private Limited company was established in 1983 as a registered private limited company and started its operations from Hyderabad. Ganga Kaveri carries out Research and Development and other scientific activities with the help of well-equipped laboratories, research stations, collaborations and programs within and outside India. Apart from North East and Kerala the company operates one way or the other by selling their seeds in the rest of states in India. Mr. Ramana Rao is the CEO of the company. He is a Master’s degree holder in Botany from Vishakhapatnam, Andhra University with specialization in genetics. Then he joined EID Parry India Ltd., and worked there since 29 years in seeds field. He worked in R & D, productions, processing, quality assurance, sales and marketing. He joined Ganga Kaveri Pvt. Ltd., 1 year and 3 months back. Mr. Ramana Rao says “Ganga Kaveri is going to launch 3 new products maize, cotton and paddy millet during the month of May, 2013.’’ “There are 15-20 companies really concentrating on Research and Development in seeds and can sustain competition. But small companies definitely will have problems facing the competition with heavy investments in R & D and biotechnology. The main challenge will be large seed loss and legislation. Legislation in one way it’s good and in another way it’s bad. Good in the sense, whatever research one has done, he will be recognized and get a protection from piracy. That is a good thing. The other side of legislation is, the overall legislation creates a lot of problems for genuine companies. Law is always good, there is nothing wrong with the law, but implementation and interpretation at local level becomes difficult. Sometimes, even a small thing can become a big issue and the license can get cancelled or stopped. The seed business being seasonal, any problem during a particular season can affect the overall turnover of the company for the entire year. That is a major challenge,’’ adds Ramana Rao. “Maize and rice has got potential for growth. These are two important crops. Drought tolerance is an important factor and key requirement of Indian farmers since monsoon is very erratic. Once these crops are through the drought tolerance then farmers can benefit a lot. If you take rice and maize cultivation of 10 years, both these crops are more or less stabilized. Any yield growth has to come from other factors other than increase of area. Here biotechnology will play a major role,’’ opines Ramana Rao. “Genetically modified seeds are available only in one crop i.e., cotton. For other crops, still there are no genetically modified seeds in India. Worldwide, genetically modified seeds are used in most of the crops, but in India only cotton is the only crop for which genetically modified seeds are used, i.e., BT Cotton cultivation. BT technology has got a gene which is toxic in nature for insects. There is an insect called bollworm which cuts the leaves. As soon as it cuts the leaves, the poison will go into it and the insect will die after sometime. That’s how the farmers can concentrate on cultivation. This used to cause lots of yield loss earlier. With the introduction of bollworm technology, i.e., BT technology, the loss due to bollworm has come down considerably. That is one benefit of the technology,’’ says Ramana Rao.
