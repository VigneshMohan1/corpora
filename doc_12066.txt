The aim is to strengthen the case for engaging researchers, to promote macro-economic research on the issues of rainfed areas, promoting partnerships with civil society organisations, research institutions, government agencies and departments and donors who see the need for increased investments in rainfed areas and organize consultations on policy issues to feed into the planning process.   Chetna Organic is anchoring the node on Revitalizing Rainfed Soils (RRS) to promote different alternative measures towards enhancing soil productivity through addition of organic matter in ecologically distressed rainfed areas to evolve and advocate alternatives in the mainstream programs through a synthesis of field experiences. Chetna works with a number of partner agencies in the interventions and established standalone pilots on soil fertility in 8 states.     Updates Update on Revitalizing Rainfed Agrculture Programs Green Cotton (New Program) Seed Guardians (New Program) Chetna Organic & Fair Trade Cotton Intervention Program Enhancing the capacities of the producer organizations for market development Jackpot Community Development Program Indo-German Watershed Development Project Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) Peace By Peace Cotton Project Orissa Tribal Empowerment and Livelihoods Program Plus (OTELP+) Pratima Organic Growers Groups – ProCotton Program Convergence of Agriculture Initiatives in Maharashtra (CAIM) Revitalizing Rainfed Agriculture Network (RRA) Copyright © Chetna Organic.
