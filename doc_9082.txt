Each bank seems to charge a different rate of interest. When we negotiate the bank lowers the rate. What is your opinion? Uneducated farmers who visit the bank are not treated with respect. If a businessman visits the bank they are treated with respect. What is your response? Regards, Shweta Reply With Quote December 26th, 2013 #2 editorialteam Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 1,063 Mr. H.K. Prakash, Founder, HK Global Enterprise says- It is right. That is the reason we need to be aware of available source and value. Uneducated farmers who visit the bank are not treated with respect. If a businessman visits the bank they are treated with respect… No. It is not so. Nowadays banks are also doing good work.

Barathi, Director, Growmore Biotech says- We had taken loan from SIPCOT, Chennai for our tissue culture lab establishment. Initially, when we tried with National Banks such as State Bank of India and Indian Bank, we could not succeed in getting loan even after pursuing for one year. It is difficult to go through the Nationalized Banks for tissue culture project. With regard to loan for cultivation of bamboo in India, it is difficult to get loan for precision farming in Bamboo, whereas easy to get loan for traditional farming. It is mainly because of lack of "Scale of Finance" for Bamboo cultivation by precision farming. However, there are few instances where, farmers with good influence have managed to get loan. You are right Shweta, there is no clarity on interest rate charged by banks for agri and farm loans. This happens mainly because of the classification of farmer and the size of loan and also opinion of the Manager on the farmers’ willingness to repay the loan (rating the farmer). This also changes depending on the loan considered as Project Loan or Agriculture Loan. I agree with you that all banks should have one rate of interest. This does not happen in India. (This is the same case when we convert our dollar into Indian rupee Last week when we received 250 thousand dollars and converted into Indian rupee, there were many variables. RBI Rate Rs.62.24 for one dollar while the rate was low in all nationalized banks, starting from 25 paisa to 125 paisa.) India should get into a single interest rate and the rate should be low for agriculture. The interest rate for tractor for agriculture is higher than interest rates for a car loan. I also do agree with you that uneducated farmers visiting bank are not treated with respect. This is not only to bank, I find everywhere. This is because of the low social value we are giving to the farmer. We rarely find even educated farmer makes the visiting card as "FARMER". I find this in abroad and there the farmers are treated on par. In Maharashtra, farmers are treated better. In fact, in India, farmers are subsidizing the food we eat by taking lower return on Agriculture than a stock broker.

The bank manager has to watch for the stick from his bosses about the 'safety' of his loan. Entrepreneur is regarded as a 'un-employable' who is going for a business. Government has its plans controlled by persons (aka, KVIC staff) who never ever took risk in their lives. It is only the farmer/ entrepreneur who has to bear the burden of risk (including failure) this has created a sorry situation wherein even the MBA pass-outs are looking for jobs and not going for entrepreneurships. Bank manager looks at every one by how he can fit into his plans of meeting targets: loans, KCC or whatever. Let us understand the rural branch manager is most likely on a 'punishment' or ' tenure' posting, (else he would have wanted to be in a city).

There is no clarity on the interest rate charges by banks to farm and agri loans. - Yes, you are right and it differs in each bank. We should have proper planning and be able to present it to the banker which will assure the bank that you will not default. Also the way you approach makes a huge difference in getting the better interest rates. This is true even educated famers are sometimes treated badly. But we do have bankers who are very cooperative and helpful. But agriculture is always second to any other business which is true and we need to change that. We need to prove them wrong by not failing in our repayments and we need to get knowledge about the schemes available for farmers. Farming community should be more united and start sharing knowledge which is lacking today.
