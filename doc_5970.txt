The Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA) is a place for students of different cultures, backgrounds, and experiences to come together in an effort to learn more about each other and about themselves. OMA takes a holistic approach to empower Oklahoma State University students to think and act in ways that will embrace and promote a more inclusive world. We aim to assist students in achieving academic excellence, developing their personal and professional character, and engaging in the campus and greater community. OMA achieves these goals by offering scholarships, leadership development programs, mentoring opportunities and cultural education programs. We are also the home to several of Oklahoma State's cultural affinity groups, including the African-American Student Association, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Asian-American Student Association, Hispanic Students Association, Native American Student Association, Vietnamese Student Association, Oklahoma State Queers & Allies, and the Womens Programming Advisory Council. OMA is here to serve all students by connecting them with opportunities and resources for academic, personal and professional development as we prepare students to live and thrive in a culturally diverse world. For more information on OMA programs and services, contact the Office of Multicultural Affairs at 240 Student Union, oma@okstate.edu or 405-744-5481.
