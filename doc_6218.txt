Soil physical quality (SPQ) can be a platform that involves assessment of soil properties and processes as they relate to the ability of a soil to function effectively as a component of a healthy ecosystem. Geo referenced soil samples collected from some maize growing soils from Khagaria and Bhagalpur districts of Bihar were subjected to physical and chemical analysis The pH of the selected soils ranged from 7.45 to 8.09, EC from 0.145 – 0.457 dS m-1, soil organic carbon from 0.26-0.89 %, and, Available N, P and K from 100.4 to 179.8, 26.24 to 76.26 and 129.55 to 599.20 kg ha-1, respectively. The bulk density, maximum water holding capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soils ranged from 1.38 to 1.66 Mg m-3, 43.7 to 53.1 % and 0.39 to 0.80 mm hr-1, respectively. MWD & GMD of water stable aggregates ranged from 0.459 to 3.820 mm and 0.552 to 1.323 mm respectively. Principal components analysis for the soil physical quality indicators revealed that the principal component 1 was the only principal component having Eigen value > 1 and organic carbon, maximum water holding capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, mean weight diameter of soil separates and percentage clay were highly weighted under PC1. The soil physical quality indices under study were mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter of water stable aggregates, percentage of water stable aggregates greater than 0.25 mm, structural stability index, dispersion ratio, clay ratio, erosion ratio and soil erodibility ‘K’ estimated using nomographic equation & the value at maximum membership of the fuzzy K frequency distribution estimated using the fuzzy logic based program FUZKBAS. These were found to be significantly correlated with SPQ indicators. Hence we recognize them as indices of soil physical quality. The results of stepwise regression show that organic carbon and soil separates (clay content) are the most important variables determining the availability of nitrogen and potassium. Potassium also shows significant and positive correlation with clay content. It may be concluded that clay and organic carbon content can be the potential indicators of the physical quality for the maize growing soils. These indicators can be used to describe the state of soil physical quality of the maize growing soils on their own as well as on the basis of several indices such as mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter of water stable aggregates, percentage of water stable aggregates greater than 0.25 mm, stability index, dispersion ratio, clay ratio, erosion ratio and estimates of the soil erodibility factor K, in which clay and organic matter content are contributing factors. There are indications that the maize growing soils are of poor physical quality and need to be managed judiciously. 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z Studies on genetic diversity in rice (Oryza Sativa L.) Singh, Parmeshwar Kumar http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/handle/1/63868 2015-05-27T11:26:19Z 2013-01-01T00:00:00Z Title: Studies on genetic diversity in rice (Oryza Sativa L.) Authors: Singh, Parmeshwar Kumar Abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the staple cereal crops of the world and it is one of the main source of carbohydrate for nearly one half of the world population .Genetic diversity is the basic requirement for making progress in crop breeding. Inclusion of genetically divergent parents of any breeding programme is essential to create new genetic stocks. Genetic diversity is the most important tool in hands of the plant breeder in choosing the right type of parents for hybridization programme. The divergence can be studied by technique using D2 statistics developed by Mahalanobis (1936).It is based on multivariate analysis and grouped into various cluster as given by Rao (1952).This is considered as the most effective method for qualifying the degree of genetic diversity among the genotypes including in the study. From the experimental result it may be concluded that GK.HEMA recorded to be the best performer for grain yield/hill, harvest index, test weight, number of spikelet/panicle, flag leaf width, likes wise ORJ 1024 for number of tillers/hill, flag leaf length and panicle length, AD 08142 for number of effective tillers/hill, number of fertile spikelets/panicle and spikelets fertility % and OR 2322-25 for grain l/b ratio and grain yield (t/ha). The characters with high heritability coupled with genetic advance as per cent of mean were, number of spikelet/panicle, number of fertile spikelet/panicle, straw yield/hill, biological yield/hill, plant height, days to 50 % flowering, spikelet fertility percentage should be given top priority during selection of the genetically divergent parent for future utilization as parents in breeding programme. The genotype of Cluster-IV (OR 2322-25), Cluster-VI (PAU 3835-12-1-1-2), Cluster IX (AD 08142) and Cluster II (GK.HEMA) having desired mean value for characters like days to 50 % flowering, plant height, grain l/b ratio, grain yield, number of spikelets/panicle, test weight, grain yield/hill were more divergent from genotypes of Cluster-V (RP 5341 PSBRC 68 & ORJ 1024) having desired mean for straw yield, biological yield, number of tiller/hill, flag leaf length, panicle length. Thus, these genotypes may be used in future hybridization programme. To achieve the desired segregants for mid duration irrigated rice variety with higher yield. As the results was based on one year data, further, experimentation is required to corroborate the results. 2013-01-01T00:00:00Z Agri-entrepreneurs of Bihar Aditya Sohane, R.K. Jaiswal, U.S., eds. http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/handle/1/63867 2015-05-25T10:53:29Z 2015-01-01T00:00:00Z Title: Agri-entrepreneurs of Bihar Authors: Aditya; Sohane, R.K.; Jaiswal, U.S., eds. Abstract: The book “Agri-entrepreneurs of Bihar” is a collection of successful cases of farmers who have transformed agriculture into a mega-entrepreneurial activity in Bihar. The cases are from all the twenty Krishi Vigyan Kendras located in different districts of Bihar under the jurisdiction of Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour. The cases in several domains of agriculture and allied disciplines underline the importance of agriculture in the state which has the capability to bring about a change in the entrepreneurial potential of the state. 2015-01-01T00:00:00Z HAPPENING AT BAU BAU http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/handle/1/63866 2015-05-25T10:17:01Z 2015-05-01T00:00:00Z Title: HAPPENING AT BAU Authors: BAU 2015-05-01T00:00:00Z
