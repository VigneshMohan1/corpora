Upon signing a contract, TV stations freely receive from Access Agriculture the high resolution files of the desired videos in international and national languages and broadcast them at no cost to reach out to millions of rural households. TV stations that signed up last month are Tunde Agric TV (Benin), Times TV (Malawi) and Channel of All Nations (Malawi). So far, videos hosted on the Access Agriculture website have been broadcast in 13 African and Asian countries, showing how quality farmer-to-farmer training videos contribute to scaling up sustainable agriculture and local innovations across borders.
