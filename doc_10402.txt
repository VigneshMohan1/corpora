Go to the shop Infinite Solar – solar lanterns Home Infinite Solar – solar lanterns Mumbai based manufacturers and suppliers of solar lanterns and solar LED tube lights Manan Mody Infinite Solar was established in December 2011, but it was formally registered in November 2012 in Mumbai. The company is located in Mumbai. Messrs. Manan Mody and Krunal Prajapati are the founders. It manufactures solar lanterns and solar LED tube lights and does not have any manufacturing collaboration with any other company. It comes in 7 variants. Each product comes with a charger. There are two options for charging. A customer can use it either with a solar panel or an electric charger. Once the evening darkness sets in, villagers can no longer carry on with their work. Majority of the houses are dependent on products they manufacture in their own houses. By using ultra solar LED tube lights they can increase their income by getting more output than during the dark hours. Commonly used candles and kerosene lamps pose them a threat of fire if left unattended. Hence, it would be ideal to switch over to solar lanterns. LED based solar lanterns give enough backup of more than 5 hours, which is more than enough for home use. Mr. Manan Mody is the partner of the company and he is a management graduate from Jaihind College, Mumbai University. He was working in the investment banking industry as a financial analyst for 20 years before venturing into solar field. [hidepost] Mr. Krunal Prajapati is a B.Tech (Civil) from VJTI, Mumbai. He was working in a construction company as a Junior Engineer prior to joining Infinite Solar as a partner. Mr. Manan Mody says, “Our solar lanterns and solar LED tube lights are mainly used in rural areas where there is no electricity and where people depend on harmful kerosene lamps. Our products are also used by customers who are currently facing acute power shortage in cities. The solar lanterns are 7 to 8 times brighter than the normal candles/ kerosene lamps and our LED tube lights can be used to light up an area of 200 sq. ft. Our LED lamps can be charged by solar panels as well as electric chargers.’’ “People love our products for their utility and price. Initially it was difficult for us to penetrate the market, as our main market is in the rural areas, but eventually we are signing up dealers for these remote areas. Also, our pricing is very competitive. Our products are much better than the competitors in terms of technical specification and quality, and also the cost is 50 percent lower than their products,’’ adds Mr. Manan Mody. “Our main competitors are SELCO, Andslite, Tapan Solar, Madhuri Solar, Jyoti Solar and Greenlight planet. Our product pricing is extremely aggressive. The light output in our product is at least 5 times more than that of our competitors. We provide Lithium Ion batteries, which lasts for more than 5 years. In the next five years, our main concern is product improvement, enlisting new dealers, setting up regional sales and service offices in almost all the cities,’’ proudly says Mr. Manan.
