It was founded by Mr. S.S. Maharajan, whose fascination for agriculture and livestock farming ultimately led him to start the farm. Huge potential market for goats and lack of availability of good live stock in the market led to Kanni Farms carving a name for it. The annual turnover of the farm is Rs. 7 Lakhs/annum. The farm currently has 150 animals, all of which are pure breeds. No cross breeds are handled in the farm. Kanni and Thalassery, also known as Malabari, are the two breeds available here. Animals are vaccinated under the supervision of a qualified veterinarian as per schedule. Vaccinations given include PPR and TT. Albndasol, senmentasol and hytec are used for de-worming. As green fodder CO4, KFS 29, Velimasal, Muyal Masal and Akathi while as dry fodder dried groundnut leaves are given to the animals. Since concentrates are readily available in the market, the same is given to the animals. “Goat farming is not difficult if you take proper care in a timely and systematic manner by yourself without depending on farm labors completely,” says Mr. Maharajan. All animals are sold to the public directly without any help from middlemen. Mr. Maharajan believes middle men tend to reap all benefits of the farmer’s hard work. He goes on to add that when the stock is sold at competitive prices, people directly approach the seller. New farms and local end users are the target customers of the farm. The demand for animals depends on the effect of marketing through social networks and the web. Seasonal festivals also create higher demand for goats. Kanni Farms hopes to turn into an integrated farm by including dairy and poultry. The farm is working towards this process. Mr. Maharajan holds an M.B.A in Marketing. He has worked for telecom domain for more than 8 years with leading telecom providers like Reliance and Aircel. He developed his knowledge on goats by visiting nearby farms and KVKs. He joined the goat farming industry two years ago and has been continuing a successful stint in the field since then.
