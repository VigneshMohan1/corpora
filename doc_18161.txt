Historical background National Highway 1 is one of the oldest and most prominent national highways of India, which links New Delhi to Pakistan border. It starts from New Delhi and ends in the town of Atari in Punjab. In medieval times it was the part of famous Grand Trunk Road built by Sher Shah Suri. The extension of this highway down south is called NH2. After Atari, it passes through Amritsar Jalandhar, Phagwara, Ludhiana, Rajpura, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat, Kundli, finally reaching Delhi. The total length of the road is 456km. It is the shortest route between Delhi and Lahore via Wagah border. The strip from Amritsar to Jalandhar is four-lane and from Jalandhar to Delhi, it is six lane. In Delhi it is called the Ring Road and is eight-lane road here. State wise description of NH1 NH1 starts from Wagah border at Atari village and you have to cruise thirty kilometers inside Punjab to reach Amritsar from Atari. If you continue cruising along NH1 you'll find districts of Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Ludhiana ,Sangrur and Patiala dotting the highway ; however the NH 1 does not pass through these cities. The only town it passes through is Rajpura, when we enter the state of Haryana. The first district we encounter along NH1 is Ambala. Then, we travel through the districts of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat and Sonipat. Kurukshetra city is very near to NH1. In Ambala district, when we take NH 1, it leads us to Ambala Cantonment Junction, which is proximate to the Ambala City. After crossing Sonipat, NH1 goes into its last lap to reach NCR. This part of NH1 is developing rapidly and it seems like a jungle of concrete with multi-storied buildings scattered all around. We enter the NCR at the Singhu Border in North Delhi before reaching Inter State Bus Terminal at Kashmiri Gate. Going further it becomes Ring Road and as we travel down south in the capital it becomes NH 2, which takes us to Bangladesh Border in the east. The stretch of NH1 in Delhi is the narrowest one and marred with encroachment and illegal settlements because of the poor planning of the NCR. NH1 has been extended into further four spur-roads which are called as 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D. NH1 A starts from Jalandhar and passes through Madhopur, Jammu, Banihal, Srinagar, Baramula and the it finally reaches Uri. Rest of the three spur routes are completely inside Jammu and Kashmir. NH1 B starts from Batote, Doda, Kistwar and reaches Khanaval through Symthan pass. NH1 C is from Domel to Katra.
