Due to unprecedented floods, for want of proper drainage facilities and also the alkaline nature of soil necessitated the change of site to a better place which was ultimately located at Sirugamani with effect from December 1959 with an area of 24.83 hectares.

MANDATE ·          To solve the problems in sugarcane cultivation in wetland under flow irrigation. ·          To evolve high yielding, high quality sugarcane varieties which are resistant to early drought and late water logging, saline and alkaline conditions, red rot, smut and inter node borer. ·          To develop Integrated Nutrient Management practices with special emphasis on soil-plant-health care. ·           To produce Breeder Seeds in Rice Varieties i.e.,   ADT 39, ADT 43 and   ADT (R ) 45 Technologies developed List of Varieties released I.

TNAU Sugarcane SI 7 2010 Early Co 99043 X CoG 93076 154.0 13.05 Tolerant to drought and red rot. It produces light purple coloured thick and straight cane.   It is a non flowering type.   It has no spines which favours easy detrashing. TNAU Sugarcane SI 8 2012 Mid-late CoC 90063 X Co 8213 146.0 12.90 Tolerant to drought, water stagnation and red rot. It produces pale green coloured thick and straight cane and best suited for mechanical cultivation.   It has no spines and easy for detrashing. It performs well under problem soils.
