He holds an M.Sc. in agriculture from UAS, Bangalore. He has served his current organization for over 26 years. “Being working in Coconut Development Board in different capacities in different locations, interacting with the farmers and groups is challenging and enterprising and also motivating the entrepreneurs to establish coconut processing units” shares Mr. Vijayakumar on mentioning the important turning points throughout his long stretched successful career with the association. Coconut Development Board sponsors R & D program through different research institutes like CPCRI, Agri., Universities, CFTRI and DFRL. Mr. Vijayakumar adds that coconut production and productivity has increased considerably over the years, thanks to the intervention of the Board. The Board has also conducted various training programs on palm climbing and plant protection to provide self employment opportunities to various individuals. Mr. Vijayakumar throws some light on the Coconut Development Board’s plan on integrated farming program in coconut holdings for productivity improvement. This scheme named “Integrated farming for productivity improvement” aims at improving the production and productivity of coconut holdings through an integrated approach. Laying out of Demonstration Plots and Organic Manure Units are the two schemes implemented under this approach. Under the first scheme, “financial assistance of Rs. 35000/- per ha is provided in two annual installments for adoption of integrated management practices in disease affected gardens in cluster basis. The objective of the program is to demonstrate sustainable coconut cultivation practices by incorporating both scientific as well as local proven technologies and also including inter-crops so as to achieve maximum return through group action” shares Mr. Vijayakumar. Further explaining Organic Manure Units scheme, he adds that the scheme promotes use of organic manure. Financial assistance of 20000/- per unit or 50% of the cost of production is provided for setting up of a unit. Increasing production and productivity of coconuts, pest and disease control are some of the challenges, he says, faced by coconut farmers today. High input and labor costs and getting remunerative prices for coconut and copra are the other challenges. Mr. Vijayakumar goes on to explain the various services offered by the board to farmers. These services include Area Expansion Program, Production & Productivity Improvement, Pest & Disease Management, seedlings production, and setting up of coconut processing units for value addition. The farmers can visit the Board’s website www.coconutboard.gov.in where office addresses, phone numbers and email IDs are available. The site also contains details of all schemes.
