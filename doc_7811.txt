Actually I did set an #NPSF PR this morning! 33:20 = 35s faster than 33:55 last month! Apparently I misremembered my last month’s time as 32:55. I was so sure of my previous PR this morning and when I wrote my previous post that I didn’t even click back to last month’s post until just now. No wonder I was a lot closer to the people just ahead of me this time. I was over half a minute faster! So yeah, the 3/1 minute run/walk Galloway method totally worked. - Tantek tantek.com Search ← → In reply to: http://tantek.com/2015/147/t1/npsf-pr-wednesday-slower https://twitter.com/t/status/603774092446076928 Actually I did set an #NPSF PR this morning! 33:20 = 35s faster than 33:55 last month!
