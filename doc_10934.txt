The company has its head office in Pune. The company was founded by Mr. Anil Wanarse Patil. The company is engaged in the production and marketing of strawberry, sweet corn, and baby corn; marketing of seasonal fruits like grapes, pomegranate, and mango; and marketing of exotic fruits and vegetables. The company is also into the institutional marketing of fruits and vegetables; production and marketing of cereals, pulses and oilseeds. Sprout Natural also provides consultancy services for mushroom and banana cultivation; and is into market research of agri projects. Speaking about the initial problems faced by the company, Mr. Wanarse says, “I did not have enough funds initially but that problem was solved by my family and slowly I started taking steps ahead.” He adds, “Now we are growing at a good rate. Sprout has strong presence in markets like Pune, Bangalore, Mumbai and started operations in Mauritius also.” Marketing The company mainly targets processing units, hotels, caterers, restaurants, and wholesaler as potential customers. “In fresh fruits and vegetables we don’t have any brands. But we have private labeling of our own named “Sprout” for fresh baby corn, sweet corn and other exotics and all Indian fruits and vegetables,” says Mr. Wanarse. The company generally sells its products to wholesaler in a particular area where direct distribution to hotels and restaurants is not possible. “Another way of selling is directly to hotels, restaurants and various other categories,” adds Mr. Wanarse. Competition When asked about competition, Mr. Wanarse says, “We are doing good in the market as we focus on quality production. Here we manage our own supply chain like cultivation, good agriculture practices, harvesting, grading, packaging, dispatch by cold van, and marketing directly to customers. Because of managing the same we are price competitive in the market and providing highest quality fruits and vegetables to customers.” Further speaking about the challenges faced, he says, “We have a wide range of products but are focusing on quality and not quantity. So, automatically our small volume business is giving us highest returns. All our departments are small but strong. The main challenge faced is to make our product move in the market consistently with same amount of profit generation.” There are 10 employees working in the office and around 25 people are working on field. Sprout has a joint venture with Natures Agritech Ltd, Mauritius. “So we have started now targeting customers in the Mauritius and getting good business out of that,” says Mr. Wanarse, adding, “We are in the initial phase of our business and hence focused more in Indian market only.” Consultancy Services Sprout Consultancy Services is the sister concern of Sprout Naturals, which works completely in the area of agribusiness consulting on various projects like hitch mushroom cultivation, dairy farming, poultry farming and all fruits and vegetable commercials. “Also with this we do have markets research wing for specialized in agri projects,” informs Mr. Wanarse, adding, “So, in coming years we want to spread our wings in to processing plant, consulting and market research projects focus in future and more concentrate for exports.” Mr. Patil is B.Sc. (agriculture), PGDABPM in agribusiness and plantation management from Indian Institute of Plantation Management, Bangalore.  He worked as asst. manager (operations) in Interavion India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore for a year before setting up Sprout Naturals.
