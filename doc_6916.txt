Welcome to National Institute of Nutrition      Food and Drug Toxicology Research Centre (FDTRC)            Gopalan Block   The Stepping Stones   Recognizing the significant contributions made by NIN in the field of food toxins, the Food & Drug Toxicology Research Centre (FDTRC) was established as separate centre in the year 1978. The mandate was to investigate food borne disease outbreaks and undertake toxicological evaluation of foods and drugs. FDTRC, located at NIN, is today a major national centre for insightful research in fungal toxins, pesticide residues, food additives, heavy metals, pharmacokinetics , diet & chronic degenerative disorders and nutrient-drug interactions. The Centre is also engaged in environmental monitoring as well as biomonitoring to study human exposures to carcinogens/toxins in the environment and their biological impact. This centre shares certain essential facilities like equipment, library etc., with NIN.  Analysis of mycotoxins               Ame's test to detect carcinogens       HACCP Analysis of food items   Objectives To investigate food borne disease outbreaks and to identify the causative factor(s) Surveillance and monitoring of environmental contaminants Detection of newer adulterants/ toxicants in foods To develop analytical methods for detection of adulterants/ toxicants To evaluate basic molecular mechanisms of toxins and develop appropriate bio-markers To study drug nutrient interactions particularly with reference to drug metabolism and toxicity. To investigate aetiopathogenesis of chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and identify their risk factors To evaluate and identify naturally occurring food ingredients which are rich in antioxidants, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and cancer prevention properties To develop bio-markers to study environmental toxicity
