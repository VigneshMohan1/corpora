Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections Madhya Pradesh (MP) Assembly Elections Results Parliamentary Constituencies Government Assembly Elections 2013 Results Delhi Election Results Chhattisgarh Election Results MP Election Results Mizoram Election Results Rajasthan Election Results Madhya Pradesh Assembly Election 2013 The 230 constituencies of Madhya Pradesh completed the 2013 assembly elections on 25th November 2013 with 70% voter turnout. The high-impact constituencies are Morena, Rewa, Gwalior, and Indore-5, and all eyes will be on December 8 when the results will be announced. The current two-time chief minister, the BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan, is the running favourite to win for a third time. The same is being confirmed by opinion polls. This is being attributed to the fact that Chouhan has been responsible for the various infrastructure developments in the state, including roads and electricity. The recent CNN-IBN-The Week survey, conducted by CSDS, claimed that BJP is likely to retain power by winning between 148 and 160 seats, with Congress securing between 52 and 62 seats. The Congress is already dipping in terms of popularity, stung by the Election Commission verdict that ridiculed the Congress's request to "cover the prominent lotus ponds in regions such as Bundelkhand" as this could boas the elections in the favor of the BJP. The Commission called the statement an insult to the intelligence of the voters. However, there could be surprises if the young Congress brigade, led by Jyotiraditya Scindia, the party's campaign committee chairman in MP and Chhattisgarh, tilts the scales. To do so he would need to gain the confidence of the state farmers, who have been committing suicide on a worrisome scale; he would also need to convince the tribal communities that the Congress party can curb Naxalism and safeguard their interests.
