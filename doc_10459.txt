Sudarshan Ritty – banker turned greenhouse consultant Committed to assist small and medium farmers in setting up greenhouse and polyhouse farming units Mr. R.G. Sudarshan Ritty has served 5 public sector banking institutions for a period of 32 years in various capacities. Having the rich experience in finance and farming domain he started agri consultancy business in 2012. He had closely observed life of farmers while serving in banks. He understands the farmer’s plight to survive in the competitive world plus his constraints like lack of finance, innovative technical knowhow and no support from anyone. Hence Mr. Sudarshan decided to bring the change in farmer’s life through his consultancy services. He says, “Since year 1998 green house was just a picture in India.” The concept was picked up later once the benefits were visible, experienced, and proved. He adds, “Today it is presumed that only privileged farmer can set it up! To make this myth irrelevant and to prove that a common farmer too can establish greenhouse farming unit, our team is on move in villages and towns in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.” He further adds, “Our aim is just to popularize the modern method of protected cultivation to increase the yield and quality of produce.” Under the guidance of Mr. Sudarshan Ritty, so far 26 farmers have successfully set-up polyhouses for Gerbera, Carnation, Capsicum, and Dutch Rose cultivation while many other farmers are using shade net medium for cultivation. Questions from readers for Mr. Sudarshan Ritty What is the minimum area required for green house construction? How much will be the green house set-up cost for half acre plot? A minimum 1000 sq. mts would be sufficient for a small income for demonstration purpose. A minimum of Rs 13.60 Lakhs would cost for fabricating half an acre of green house or 2000 sq.mts. How to set up greenhouse cultivation unit? The land should be leveled and one has to avoid shady, windy places, and areas with heavy rainfall. Ensure to get the soil Ph and water EC tested for the crops preferred for grow in the greenhouse. A standard polyhouse should have the structure life of 8 years and poly sheet life of at least 2.5 years. Please suggest how to make a greenhouse farm on my small plot of 15 cents of land. 15 cents is not even 1000 Sq. Mts, will it be profitable venture? Not recommended but if at all one wants to go ahead then follow the criteria mentioned above. Which are the crops economically viable on cost of green house constructed without any subsidy? High fetching crops like Gerbera, Carnation, and Dutch Roses are grown in poly house so that by high returns the cost can be offset at the earliest. There is hardly any farm in the entire country which has chosen the activity without subsidy. A subsidy is linked to greenhouse entrepreneurship not just to avail and wind up the business. It is to promote the activity for the prosperity of the farmer and the Nation. What is the construction cost and subsidy available by the departments for poly house and green house for growing exotic vegetables? The present market price for quality polyhouse fabrication with drip lines is anywhere between Rs 680 to Rs 700 per sq.mt viz., Rs. 27.20 – 28.00 Lakhs per 4000 sq. mts or say one acre. The subsidy available on this is 50% of the cost of poly house if it is from state supported NHM scheme, and to the Maximum of Rs 18.70 Lakhs. Do Blueberries and blackberries grow well in green house or can they be grown in open cultivation in Maharashtra? Any crop grown in greenhouse yields 8 -10 times more than open cultivation and there would be lot of difference in quality of flower & fruit on harvest. What kind of crops shall we grow in the green house in and near Dindigul area (I am interested in growing tomato or maxima flowers)? All crops can be grown in greenhouse. A green house is just a medium to make or create an agro climatic condition that is suitable to particular crops. Which variety of tomato will be the best for higher and long term production in 4000 sq meter poly-house located at Bareilly? Also suggest other crop which can be more beneficial and fruitful. As discussed any type of crop can be grown in a poly house provided you create such an agro climatic condition congenial to the crop and also the soil PH and water EC should be supportive to the particular crop you grow. Prefer growing exotic flowers and vegetables for higher returns. Contact details- Mr. R.G.
