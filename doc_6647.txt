The YOP process involves activities to align resources and programs prior to implementation. This process greatly increases the likelihood that a new academy will fulfill its promise to students and stakeholders.   Those accepted for the YOP gain access to: A guided assessment process that informs, troubleshoots, and directs the work of advance program planning and development; and Technical assistance and support from NAF, professional development activities, use of the NAF curriculum, and more.   Please refer to the Academy Application Guide for further explanation and guidance regarding making application to NAF for the Year of Planning program.       ShareThis NAF Academies Statistics & Research Our Themes Regions Why Choose NAF?
