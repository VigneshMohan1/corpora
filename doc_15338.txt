It behaves like a biennial when grown for seed production. 'Head' consisting of thick leaves overlapping tightly on growing bud is the economic part. Glucoside 'sinigrin' is the flavour principle in Cabbage. It belongs to the family assicaceae. Top... Varieties September, Pusa Drum Head, Golden Acre, Kaveri, Ganga, Sri Ganesh and Pride of India. Top... SeedsAndCultivation Cabbage can be grown in high ranges during winter season. Well-drained sandy loam to clay loam soil is suited for this crop. Since it is a cool season crop, sowing is done from August-November. Seed rate is 500-750 g/ha. Seeds are to be sown in nursery beds. Three to five weeks old seedlings are used for transplanting. Field is prepared by three or four ploughings. Seedlings are transplanted at a spacing of 45 x 45 cm. Top... WaterManagement A continuous supply of moisture is necessary for proper development of heads. Top... NutrientManagement Apply 25 t/ha FYM or compost. Fertilizer dose is N:P2O5:K2O 150:100:125 kg/ha. Apply full dose of P2O5 and half dose of N and K2O before transplanting. Apply remaining half dose one month after transplanting. Top... WeedManagement   Very shallow hoeing should be done to remove weeds and to make the soil better aerated. In order to produce large heads, earth up plants one month after transplanting. Top... PestManagement White butterfly, rootfly and aphids are major pests of cabbage. Spraying malathion at 0.1 per cent will control the damage. Diamond back moth is another major pest. IPM involving a trap crop, release of a parasitoid and application of neem seed kernel extract is recommended by IIHR against this pest. Bold seeded Indian mustard is the recommended trap crop. Spraying 4 per cent neem seed kernel extract once every three weeks is recommended. The parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum may be released 10-15 days before or after neem seed kernel extract spraying and the number of releases have to be decided based on the degree of infestation. Top... DiseaseManagement Black rot, Club rot, Black leg and cabbage yellows are the common diseases. Soaking the seeds in water at 50oC for 25-30 minutes will kill the disease causing organisms. Crop rotation involving a non-cruciferous vegetable, ensuring good drainage, removal and destruction of affected plants etc. are also suggested.   Top... Harvesting The heads are harvested at full maturity and when they are firm from December to April in the plains and in June-July in Hills (summer crop). The entire plant is uprooted and the heads separated. Top... Processing Not Available Top... AverageYield 20-25 tons/ha..
