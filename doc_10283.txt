Go to the shop Bharath Agro Sales Corporation – Organic farming inputs Home Bharath Agro Sales Corporation – Organic farming inputs Manufactures customized organic farming inputs adhering to plantation requirements Balachandran V. C Bharath Agro Sales Corporation located at Mardala, Karnataka was setup in 2001. Mr. Balachandran V. C. is the founder of the company. All organic bio-fertilizers produced by company are sold under the brand name Yashas. Mix of eleven natural ingredients is the key to every product formulation. The products are customized according to the requirements of the soil and crop grown in the farm. Mr. Balachandran shares, “after receiving the sales order, we first enquire about oral deficiency of nutrients in the soil along with details of the nutrients applied earlier in the same farm. Our customers are fully aware of our quality and we are getting good response for our products”. He further adds, “we are using poultry manure, sheep manure, coir pith, coffee husk and wood ash”. These are well composted and blended with neem cake, caster cake, pongamia cake, sugar press mud bone meal and super ash phos in a particular ratio. As per the requirements of the farmers the ratio of the ingredients is decided. For example in some plantations the farmers are given slurry or green leaf manure, cowdung, castercake etc as the percentage of ‘N’ is high at the same time phosphorous and potassium deficiency is very high. Hence bone meal, wood ash and super ash phos is added for equalization of N P K to provide immediate nutritional equalization to plant. “Goodwill and success of any product is completely dependent on its quality. Good packing, advertisements etc are secondary features”, opines Mr. Balachandran. Market is competitive with many small and multinational companies but Bharath Agro Sales Corporation is confident for its quality and result oriented products. Presently the products are available in Karnataka and Kerala market. Plans are to reach Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh as well. 61 co-operative societies at Karnataka and many estates of Kerala are company’s main customers. Since the products are customized small growers to estates owners are target customers. As of now company is not into exports however if any enquiries came over then surely it would be addressed. Awareness is created by organizing and participating in agricultural seminars. Door to door canvassing and field demonstration is also undertaken. Mr. Balachandran shares his future plans, “we are planning to increase the capacity of our factory and appoint marketing field staffs and sales representatives to promote our business”. He is graduate in marketing and worked as area sales manager in chemical fertilizer company prior to pursing his entrepreneur venture.
