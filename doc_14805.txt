IIOE IIOE Header INTERNATIONAL INDIAN OCEAN EXPEDITION [ IIOE ] HOME ABOUT IIOE NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS OCEAN BUBBLE CONTACT US "The Indian Ocean Bubble-2" released on 28 th January 2015                Dynamics of the Indian Ocean: Perspective and Retrospective International Symposium on the Indian Ocean (Last Date for Submission of Abstracts 31 st May, 2015)   The period 2012-2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the IIOE which marked a watershed in the pursuit of knowledge of the Indian Ocean. During the last 50 years tremendous development has taken place in the field of oceanography which includes development of new observation systems such as remote sensing and Argo floats. Enhance availability of oceanographic data also facilitated developments of various numerical models which can not only be used to understand different processes but are also capable to simulate future scenarios. Various international/national expeditions such as WOCE, JGOFS, ARMEX, BOBPS, CTCZ etc hve helped enhance our understanding on the Indian Ocean. Despite these efforts we still have not developed a complete understanding of this unique basin. Compared to IIOE era presently we are better equipped to revisit outstanding scientific questions wherein a combination of in-situ observation using new technologies and model studies can be fruitfully used to provide a much better understanding of the Indian Ocean. Since IIOE laid the foundation of oceanographic research in India and we are in 50th year since IIOE, it certainly calls for grand celebration of that event. Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), under the chairmanship of Dr. Shailesh Nayak, Secretary, MoES, has formed a national co-ordination committee to 1). Take a stock of progress in oceanographic research in India 2). To suggest ways and means to celebrate 50th year anniversary of IIOE and 3). To identify and address the outstanding scientific issues in Indian Ocean oceanography.
