The nationalization of banks in India took place in 1969 by Mrs. Indira Gandhi the then prime minister. The major objective behind nationalization was to spread banking infrastructure in rural areas and make available cheap finance to Indian farmers. Fourteen banks were nationalized in 1969. Before 1969, State Bank of India (SBI) was the only public sector bank in India. SBI was nationalized in 1955 under the SBI Act of 1955. The second phase of nationalization of Indian banks took place in the year 1980. Seven more banks were nationalized with deposits over 200 crores.   1 Allahabad Bank 15 Indian Overseas bank 2 Andhra Bank 16 Oriental Bank of commerce 3 Bank of Baroda 17 Punjab & Sind Bank 4 Bank of India 18 Punjab National Bank 5 Bank of Maharastra 19 State Bank of India 6 Canara Bank 20 Syndicate Bank 7 Central Bank 21 UCO Bank 8 Corporation Bank 22 Union Bank of India 9 Dena Bank 23 United Bank of India 10 IDBI Bank 24 Vijaya Bank 11 Indian Bank 25 State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur 12 Bharatiya Mahila Bank 26 State Bank of Hyderabad 13 State Bank of Mysore 27 State Bank of Patiala 14 State Bank of Travancore     Home | About Us | Success Stories | Farmers Association | Publications | Contact Us © 2015 TNAU.
