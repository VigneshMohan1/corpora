Agra is located 363 kms from the state capital of Lucknow and is on the itinerary of all travelers- domestic and international. Apart from being an important capital city to the Mughals during their rule, Agra also finds mention in the Mahabharata, where it was called Agrevana- which meant "The Border of the Forest". It is believed that the city was founded by Raja Badal Singh, a Rajput king, who's fort Badalgarh, stood on or near the present city. Sultan Sikandar Lodi was the first ruler to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1506 and his son Ibrahim Lodi, who succeeded him, remained in power for the next nine years- finally being defeated by the first Mughal, Babur, in the First Battle of Panipat in 1526. Agra famously became the capital of the Mughal Emperors from 1526 to 1658 and still remains one of the most visited tourist destinations in India, thanks to the many historical monuments the city is home to, many of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Agra is famous for leather goods, beautiful carpets, gold and silver jewellery and handicrafts, such as zari zardozi, marble and stone carving and inlay work. The city is also known for its popular sweets such as petha and gajak and savory snacks like dalmoth.
