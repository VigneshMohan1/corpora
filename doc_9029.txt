Documents are-farm land documents,mortgage of land,residence proof from gramsevak,election card,project report,2 passport size photos,no dues certificate from society of village to which farm land belongs,2 guaranters with their adress proofs. 4.Market for goats is increasing day by day as meat requirement is increasing.Yes ofcoz u can tie up with any company for export of meat.Main importing countries of goat meat are saudi arabia,kuwait and dubai. 5.If u want to start stall feed than 1acre area is enough to construct shed for 300goats.

Here In NABARD scheme u will get 25%-50% subsidy on loan amount. U can get loan from any nationalised bank and some corporate bank. For documents chect my above post of 'Goats'.
