Advocates small scale organic trials and demonstrations Santanu Kumar Patra Subarnarekha Agri Services was established in 1997 by Mr. Santanu Kumar Patra. The company does business directly from the farmers to the companies and shares a percentage of the profit. Its services include: • Trading of agro inputs and also out puts. • Consultancy on farming of different crops and herbs. • Trading of out puts like herbs, minor forest products and farm produces. • Conservation of local seeds and planting materials • Seed production and its marketing The company offers free consultancy to local farmers. No money is demanded from farmers but only from Government agencies and NGOs. It always advocates low cost technologies. Poor infrastructure available to farmers and their poverty were the driving force for opening the company with the intent of providing free consultancy. The company mainly works for small and marginal farmers in collection, preservation and multiplication of different locally available germplasms. It also assists farmers in preparing projects reports and approaching the bankers for loans and Government agencies for subsidy, wherever there is any feasibility. For selection criteria for farmers when selecting the fertilizer and plant growth promoters of a farm, Mr. Patra suggests, “farmers should learn to prepare organic inputs from locally available resources and depend more upon these inputs. They must undergo small scale trials and demonstrations before any large scale adoption. Products should be judged as per its cost effectiveness and ecofriendly approaches.” His company helps farmers undergo small scale trials and demonstrations before any large scale adoption, under the supervision of agriculture experts. He adds that farmers can make huge profits by growing pointed gourd, spine gourd, bitter gourd, elephant foot yam, yam, colocassia, okra, brinjal and many greens. While green house is a viable option, he believes only educated farmers can make better use of it. Subarnarekha Agri gets in direct contact with target customers for marketing its services. Farmers who have a successful stint with the company then refer it to the other farmers. Though it does advertise its services in the newspapers and internet, they haven’t been as successful as word to mouth marketing. The company successfully distilled Betelvine oil in small scale. It plans to work on it and more essential oils in the future. While adhering to its plan of growing the business, it will continue to provide free consultancy to farmers and work more on local seeds, seed production and marketing.
