Initially it was a trading company engaged in collection of herbs from jungle, herbs were sun-dried and then sold in the market,” shares Mr. Mayank Dholakia, “Now, we have evolved to train people how to collect and how to store these herbs for its’ better value under the guidance of my father, Mr. Mukesh Dholakia, CEO. We then process the herbs and seeds at our processing center and export the products across the South Eastern countries.” Company deals with long-standing tribe for collection of all forest related products. “The people from whom we source our products are the real tribal living solely in dense forest. They are of native origin. We give them technical know-how as when and how to collect, how to store the forest commodities but they are not bound in any contract to sell the products only to us. They are free to sell to anyone they want,” he informs. Government has fixed prices for all commodities. “Usually we buy at higher price than the market prices,” he adds. All forest products are grown naturally unlike other crops that are cultivated in fields and the tribes have good knowledge about these products yet they are trained, “Tribe were collecting forest commodities well but they were not storing it properly hence their hard work could not fetch them money. Forest products have high moisture so needs to be stored properly else it loses its potency and cannot be sold in market,” informs Mr. Dholakia. Company trains tribe to manage the moisture of these commodities in right way. Each product has a different processing requirement with respect to its moisture content, “We train the tribe for the same. In this way quality of products is at par. As a result when we process these commodities the quality of finished product is good,” he adds. Dealing with tribe surely is challenging but company has made it through. Tribes are trained to collect many products, “Approximately they collect 200 products every month. So it is regular dealing with tribes across the year for different forest products,” he shares, “Our subsidiary company is responsible for interacting with tribe for training, procurement, collection and payments.” Tamarindus Indica, Terminalia Chebula, Nux Vomica, Buckwheat Hull, Senna Leaf and Arrow Root Powder are few of the products company deals in. 95% of annual sales is made outside India by the company. The orders are sent to customer’s location through seaways. Herbs and spice manufacturers are the main target customers of Babulal Sarabhai & Co. “We create awareness on our products and identify new buyers by participating in different trade shows where we put our product display,” informs Mr. Dholakia. Sharing future plans he says, “We plan to add few more spices in our product list which are rare and not very common in International market.” Mr. Mayank Dholakia holds MBA in International trade from The University of Glasgow, UK. He signs off, “I wanted to take my family business to new heights internationally and degree from UK has helped me largely to understand trade business across the geographical borders.” Contact details- Babulal Sarabhai & Co B-204, Balaji Garden, Opp. Patidar Bhawan, Fafadih Timber Market, Raipur – 492001, Chhatisgarh, India Mobile – 97132-00002, 98271-21777 Email – mayank.dholakia@yahoo.com Website – http://www.cassiatoraseeds.com/ Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Babulal Sarabhai & Co – sources forest related products from tribes Related – articles, consultants, downloads Hari Agro Products Gokhale Agro Products Panchavati Herbals Marven Bio Chem- Herbal products You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
