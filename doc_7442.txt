High yielder. Largely grown in Tamil Nadu under rainfed environment TKM 10 1992 Non lodging, semi dry, medium slender, resistant to blast and brown plant hopper. Photo sensitive (Season bound) TKM 11 1998 Withstand drought, capacity to rejuvenate after rain, high response to low fertilizer application, long slender, tolerant to stem borer, leaf folder, green leaf hopper, bacterial leaf blight TKM 12 2002 Withstand drought, capacity to rejuvenate after rain, high response to low fertilizer application, medium slender, tolerant to stem borer, leaf folder, green leaf hopper, bacterial leaf blight. High protein content (9.9%)     Agronomy  Growing of Black gram in sornavari (April – May) , rice in samba(August – September) and groundnut in navarai (December – January) was found to be profitable cropping system in Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts Summer ploughing followed by spraying of thiobencarb @ 2.5l/ha at 8 DAS controlled weeds effectively in rainfed rice Growing of rice and blackgram at 4:1 ratio was economical under rainfed farming in samba season System of Rice Intensification(SRI) gave higher yield with low input  Crop Physiology Seed hardening agents viz., 1% KCL, DAP, ammonium molbdate, calcium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 10% solution of cows urine and garlic extract enhanced germination, tillering ability and grain yield in rice varieties   Agricultural Entomology To control black bug, acephate 625g/ha or monocrotophos 1000 ml/ha or neem seed   kernel extract 5% is recommended For the control of early pests like hispa, whorl maggot and gall midge soaking the seeds in water for 10 hours and then in a solution of 8% zinc sulphate+ 0.1% methyl demeton for 12 hours was very effective.   Plant Pathology For the control of bacterial leaf blight and bacterial leaf streak, streptocycline sulphate and tetracycline mixer 300g/ha + copper oxy chloride 1250g/ha has to be applied during tillering stage To control Rice Dungro Disease monocrotophos 1000ml/ha isrecommended Contact Us The Professor and Head Rice Research Station Tirur - 602025 Sevapet Road Thiruvallur District Ph: Fax: Mail:    Dr.R.Agila ,  Professor (Agrl.Extn.) & Head Main Building of RRS, Tirur Front view of Main Building of RRS, Tirur During Vice Chancellor Visit During TRRI, Director Visit Exhibition Field diagnosis of problem  During  students visit
