Businessmen can also get bank loan.But they must have ITR slip of 20lakh for 10lakh loan. For goat farm nabard provides u maximum of 5lakh loan with 50% subsidy but on the basis of security farm.And security of farm is must in this scheme as this scheme is applicable for farmers only. Detail procedure how nabard provides u loan. First u have to prepare a file completing all the documents( Goat Farm Project Report ) that this schemes needed. Then u have to approach any nationalised bank for loan sanction say about 5lakh. For 5 lakh loan 10% is deposited by u in bank,40%by bank and 50% by nabard. But the bank here keeps the security of farm which on mortgage should be of minimum 5lakh. Last edited by smy82482; May 18th, 2013 at 10:48 PM .
