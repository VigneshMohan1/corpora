Assam's National Parks are thus quite a rage among the tourists who flock to the state to witness its amazing wildlife that is housed in the sanctuaries like the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park . Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is supposedly the fourth national park in Assam , the panoramic gateway to the mystic hilly terrains of northeast India. The sanctuary is shared between the districts of Dibrugarh and Tinsukia and stretches across the sprawling acres of nearly 340 sq. km. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is divided into nine distinct zones one of which is a wetland while dense forests occupy the remaining portions. The sparkling, sylvan wetlands paint a picture of rare beauty as the gleam like a mirage of quicksilver under the playful saffron sunbeams. The semi-wild horse that highlights the majestic grace of the wild equestrian species and the White winged Wood- Duck are the pride of the sanctuary. Gangetic River Dolphin, Indian Wild Dog, Leopard, Clouded Leopard, Elephant, Sambar, Slow Loris, Capped Langur and Indian wild water Buffalo add to the colorful milieu of wild animals. The occasional twitter of over 250 species of domestic and migratory birds break through the tranquil quietude that abounds in the sanctuary. The congenial winters and bracing spring make the months spanning from November to March the best time to visit the beautiful sanctuary that is easily accessible by rail, road as well as air.
