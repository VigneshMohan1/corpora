The OGCM is Modular Ocean Model-4.0 (MOM-4.0). The assimilation schemes used in INCOIS-GODAS is 3DVAR and Newtonian relaxation (Nudging). The 3DVAR assimilation scheme is used to assimilate observed temperature and salinity profiles, in the top 700m, from observational platforms like Argo, Moored buoys (RAMA, PIRATA/TRITON, TAO, NIOT buoys etc.), and ship-based (XBT, CTD, XCTD, etc.). Using the Newtonian relaxation scheme the model SST is nudged towards satellite blended gridded fields of SST.

Various tailor made products (ElNino indices, Global maps of monthly SST anomalies, depth-wise distribution of temperature anomalies, TCHP, etc.) are also being made available using these INCOIS-GODAS ocean analysis.Ocean analysis data from INCOIS-GODAS is available for free from 2003 to till date on INCOIS ftp server (ftpser.incois.gov.in) and also on INCOIS Live Access Server ( las.incois.gov.in ; under ocean analysis folder).
