I have gone through various replies to your post and would suggest that you need to be clear about few basic facts such as :- To run a dairy farm successfuly you require:- a) good quality of livestock i.e. Cow (min. 4000 lits per lactation) or buffaloes (min. 2500 lits per lactation). b) you can easily grow adlib fodder for 30 cattle on 5 acres. c) not having own agricultural land hardly makes any difference as fodder grown on own farm also has an opprtunity cost. d) investment required for setting up a 30 cow unit is 24 lacs. e) always start with a small herd between 30 to 60 cattles. i would have liked to elaborate more but i am having a very busy schedule right now so i had to cut it short.

Reply With Quote December 2nd, 2009 #19 cravi Join Date Jul 2008 Posts 52 Labour I certainly agree with you regarding the medium/small scale option. Unless you go big and I mean really big, it is not a viable option. Another component of a dairy farm in addition to fodder (and water and cow disease among others) is the availability of labour. It is very very difficult, I repeat extremely difficult to get good labor to work on your dairy farm. It would be interesting to note in your research how the successful ones have overcome labor difficulties. Please share your thoughts. Originally Posted by shanta_giri Hi, Great to hear, being an NRI you are also thinking the same way as I do. There is tremendous potential in this business if managed properly. As someone opined, fodder is the main concern in this business. That is true, as it is the major cost component and the whole economy of a dairy farm depends on this. If this is taken care of efficiently and cost effectiveness achieved, then there is no looking back. I have done some research on this business and have come across some great successes in this field. But a word of caution, Medium/small scale is not a viable option, you have to go big. Please keep in touch, we could share our knowledge and experiences since I am also preparing a dairy farm project, likely to implement it in Belgaum 5-6 years down the line. Please contact... Wish you best of luck.
