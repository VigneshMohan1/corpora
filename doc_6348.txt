MAFFT alignment and NJ / UPGMA phylogeny MAFFT version 7 Multiple alignment program for amino acid or nucleotide sequences There are a few cases incompatible with Avira Antivirus .  If this service does not work while running Avira, please temporarily disable Avira.  Both protein and DNA data can be affected by this problem. (2015/Apr/14) All jobs are reset at 4:00AM (JST) every Sunday. Multiple sequence alignment and NJ / UPGMA phylogeny Input : Paste protein or DNA sequences in fasta format.  Example or upload a plain text file: Use structural alignment(s) Structural alignment 1 (optional): Paste an alignment in fasta format.  Example These sequences will be aligned with the 'input' sequences above, being used as a constraint.   Structural alignment 2 (optional):   Structural alignment 3 (optional):   Structural alignment 4 (optional): Allow unusual symbols (Selenocysteine "U", Inosine "i", non-alphabetical characters, etc. ) Help UPPERCASE / lowercase : Same as input Amino acid → UPPERCASE / Nucleotide → lowercase Direction of nucleotide sequences : Same as input Adjust direction according to the first sequence (accurate enough for most cases)   Beta Adjust direction according to the first sequence (only for highly divergent data; extremely slow )   Beta Output order : Same as input Aligned Notify when finished (optional; recommended when submitting large data): Email address: Advanced settings Strategy : Auto (FFT-NS-1, FFT-NS-2, FFT-NS-i or L-INS-i; depends on data size)  Updated Progressive methods FFT-NS-1 (Very fast; recommended for >2,000 sequences; progressive method) FFT-NS-2 (Fast; progressive method) G-INS-1 (Slow; progressive method with an accurate guide tree) Iterative refinement methods FFT-NS-i (Slow; iterative refinement method) E-INS-i (Very slow; recommended for <200 sequences with multiple conserved domains and long gaps) Help L-INS-i (Very slow; recommended for <200 sequences with one conserved domain and long gaps) Help G-INS-i (Very slow; recommended for <200 sequences with global homology) Help Q-INS-i (Extremely slow; secondary structure of RNA is considered; recommended for a global alignment of highly divergent ncRNAs with <200 sequences × <1,000 nucleotides) Help Parameters : Scoring matrix for amino acid sequences: BLOSUM30 BLOSUM45 BLOSUM62 BLOSUM80 JTT100 JTT200 Scoring matrix for nucleotide sequences: 1PAM / κ=2 20PAM / κ=2 200PAM / κ=2 ↑ Switch it to '1PAM / κ=2' when aligning closely related DNA sequences. Gap opening penalty: (1.0 - 3.0) Offset value: (0.0 - 1.0) Align unrelated segments, too? in Alpha Testing (2014/Mar) If the input data is expected to be globally conserved but locally contaminated by unrelated segments, try 'Unalignlevel>>0' and 'Leave gappy regions'. Unalignlevel: 0.0 0.8 ↑ Default Try to align gappy regions anyway Leave gappy regions Mafft-homologs (Collects homologs from SwissProt by BLAST and performs profile-based alignments; Protein only): Help On Show homologs (if any) Number of homologs: (5 - 200) Threshold: E = (1e-5 - 1e-40) Plot LAST hits (DNA only): The top sequence vs the others The longest sequence vs the others Plot and alignment Plot only Alignment only Threshold: score=39 (E=8.4e-11) score=22 (E=0.00805) score=20 (E=0.0699) score=12 (E=398) Download version Mac OS X Windows Linux Source Online version Alignment mafft --add Updated!
