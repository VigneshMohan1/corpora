So we diversified in many streams,” he says. The various activities of the company include production and distribution of vermicompost and bio-fertilizers, animal husbandry, bee keeping, landscape design and development and agriculture consultancy. “Vermicompost is our specialty,” he adds. In this method of integration fodder and feed are grown for the animals and the wastes of these animals are used to produce compost which enriches the field thus increasing the yield. Honeybee facilitates the process of pollination thereby improving the yield of plants and also provides honey. For sustainable agriculture Mr. Sikri says, “Integrated farming is the need of an hour. Under animal husbandry the company is into breeding of murrah breed of buffaloes. Breeding of buffaloes is done using artificial insemination method and the heifers are imported from USA. The company at present is working for pure murrah and sahiwal, gir varieties for cows. “We want to improve making pure indigenous varieties like pure sahiwals, gir which are getting extinct day by day,” shares Mr Sikri, “We have imported a technology from USA with which we will be having a high conceive ratio and also we can have a particular sex as a result at the time of delivery.” The company also makes and sells ghee from the milk which they get from the buffaloes. Vermicomposting is our major project right now. We are investing a lot to make it mechanised and automated. For vermicompost, cow dung is the major raw material. “Right now we have a much bigger unit of vermicompost than the animal breeding farm so we procure cow dung from other dairies,” shares Mr. Sikri. However, procuring it from dairies is difficult so the company is looking forward to have a bigger breeding farm to fulfil the demand for raw material. On the landscape and design front the company focuses mainly on sub-surface drip irrigation. “We are not only protecting soil but we are also saving water,” he shares and adds, “We are installing fully automated sub-surface drip irrigation in lawns and we are also taking annual maintenance of the system.” The company have dealership of an Israel company NETAFIM. “We are trying to solve the irrigation problem in landscaping and also the agronomic practices,” he adds. “Beekeeping is a win venture,” he says. It helps in pollination of plants and also provides honey. The company sells the honey under the brand ‘Mishti’ honey. “We do not use any preservatives,” he informs. “Right now we have a small bee hive where we extract around 100 kg of honey per month which we market in the domestic market with 100 percent purity.” The company is also into sugarcane farming. “Like other activities we are concentrating on the better yield of sugarcane while using different techniques of wide row spacing etc,” he shares. In this field Dr ARS, who had a record production of sugarcane in Vapi, is the role model. Mr. Sikri speaking optimistically shares his future plans, “Our plans are to make Sikri Farms a tourist spot from where the young students can learn and explore.” Contact details- Sikri Farms Village Dhangali, PO Jandheri, Shahabad Markanda, Dist Kurukshetra, Haryana, India Mobile: 09813263838 Email: karansikri@hotmail.com Website: http://www.sikrifarms.com/ Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 5+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Mr. Karan Sikri – Integrated farming in Haryana Related – articles, consultants, downloads Mr. Daneshwar Gawande – Organic farming Goat Farming – K.Venkatesh, Vijay Farms Thumbal SRI Farmers Association – Intensive rice farming Friends Farm – Sustainable farming You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
