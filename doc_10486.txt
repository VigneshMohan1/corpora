Go to the shop Organic Certification Home Organic Certification Organic certification confirms product as organic as per established norms Dr. Amol Nirban Organic certification is undertaken by a board to convince consumers about the authenticity of an organic product. Since certification board distinctly plays the role of a third party they can impartially check a product and decide whether or not to certify it. Organic certification is supported by a constant need to develop environmentally-friendly agriculture. It also offers a form of recognition to those committed to this method of production. The major standard the Indian farmers go for is the Indian Regulation National Program for Organic Production. Regulation EC is preferred in Europe, National Organic Program in United States and then there is Japanese Agricultural Standard regulations. Various business sectors have organic products that can be certified. This is not just confined to organic agriculture and food products. Products beyond the usual agri products such as textile and cosmetic products may also need to be certified organic such as organic textile certification and organic cosmetic certification. Organic certification encourages fair trade which facilitates better trading condition. The major exports which come under fair trade include handicrafts, coffee, coco, tea, bananas, honey, cotton and wool. Fair trade is made out of dialogue transparency and greater benefits and it subsequently helps in the development of the poor farmers. Importers in other countries may want to know whether their imports have been organically produced, the laborers properly paid, and whether they live in good condition. Fair trade comes in place to answer such questions. Farmers who wish to get organic certification have to fill a form and submit the same to the certification body. The certification body then gives a quotation and proper inspection is arranged. After inspection the inspector submits a report and the farmer gets a document before certification. The certification board later issues the certificate. Ecocert is an inspection and certification body that was established in France in 1991. From its inception, Ecocert has specialized in the certification of organic agricultural products. In India, Ecocert operates from its offices at Aurangabad and Gurgaon. Ecocert has contributed to expansion of organic farming by introducing affordable schemes of certification for small and marginal farmers.
