A three year project is showing training videos to farmers in North Rift Valley. Among the videos which have been catching farmer's attention are the series on Sustainable Land Management. At the launch event the programme on Conservation Agriculture http://www.accessagriculture.orgnode/913/en fostered a lot of interest. One of the farmers said, "I wish to urge everyone in our village to atend this video shows next time they come to our village. For us today we have gone to Zambia and saw what farmers are doing there. What we have learned is that we do not have to burn the maize stalks after harvesting as we have always done here.” Among the conversation points for the farmers were: -    New farming techniques -    No need to burn maize stalks after harvesting as it helps in enhancing soil fertility -    Importance of intercropping Technoserve is now exploring the Access Agriculture website to select other suitable videos to help farmers in their target counties.  The Mobile Training Unit has two giant LCD screens, a speaker system, awnings and chairs for up to 100 people.   Categories Cereals Barley Maize Oats Other Rice Sorghum & Millet Wheat Roots, Tubers & Bananas Banana & Plantain Cassava Cocoyam Other Potatoes Sweet Potatoes Yam Vegetables Cabbages Carrots Chilli Peppers Courgettes & Marrows Cucumber Leafy Vegetables Onions & Garlic Other Peppers Pumpkin & Squash Tomatoes Pulses Beans Chick Peas Cowpeas Groundnuts Lentils Other Pigeon Peas Soya Beans Fruits & Nuts Apples Avocado Banana Cashew Nuts Citrus Coconut Dates Figs Grapes Mangoes Melons Olives Other Papaya Pineapple Shea Nuts Other Crops Bissap (Hibiscus) Cocoa Coffee Cotton Ginger Herbs & Spices Jute Mushrooms Oil Palm Other Rooibos Rubber Sugar Cane Tea Livestock Animal Health Camels Cattle Donkeys & Horses Extensive Pastoralism Goats Grassland Management Other Pigs Poultry Sheep Fish Fish Farming Other Processing Shrimp Farming Integrated Pest Management Beverage Crops Cereals Fruit & Nuts Oil Crops Other Crops Pulses Roots, Tubers & Bananas Vegetables Sustainable Land Management Agroforestry Conservation Agriculture Cross-Slope Barriers Forest Management Integrated Crop-Livestock Management Integrated Soil Fertility Management Other Pastoralism & Rangeland Rainwater Harvesting Smallholder Irrigation Smallholder Irrigation Management Mechanisation Business Skills Administration Skills Conflict Resolution Farm Management Financial Management Gender Group Formation & Cohesion Health & Safety Input Buying Leadership Marketing Networking Other Processing Storage Methods Extension Methods Farmer Field Schools Other Participatory Plant Breeding Participatory Research Participatory Varietal Selection Plant Health Clinics Seed Production & Dissemination Other Agriculture & Health Beekeeping Biodiversity Conservation Climate Change Adaptation Food Safety Other Silk Production Vermi Composting Water Management Agtube Sponsored by
