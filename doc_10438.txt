Go to the shop Marven Bio Chem- Herbal products Home Marven Bio Chem- Herbal products Produces and trades herbal products Marven Bio Chem was established in 2010 by Mr. Venkat Ramulu. The major herbal products dealt by the company include garcinia and shilajit. The annual turnover of the company is Rs. 2 crores. The manufacturing plant of the products is situated near Hyderabad. Since the company does not have a farm of its own, the products are procured from traders in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Curcumin, garcinia and shilajit provided by the company have great market in India and countries like USA, Germany and Japan. Farmers associated with the company are assured of a good price for their yield. “In domestic and international market we have our customers. We create awareness by using technology. We have good relationship with our clients”, shares Mr. Venkat. The company supplies its products in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai. It will soon start providing direct supply of its products outside India. The only challenges that Marven Bio Chem faces in the field are procurement of raw materials, followed by prices. The company also faces difficulties with certain crops like aloevera that demand high attention when it comes to processing. Aloevera is generally required to process within 24 hours of its cultivation. Ashwaganda and coleus cultivation benefit in marketing to get good returns in agriculture. Turmeric, choleuse, ashwaganda and gymnema give more benefits commercially, in India. Mr. Venkat further adds that selling medicinal products within the country fetches more profits than exporting the same. In the future, Marven Biochem hopes to increase its capacity and provide employment to atleast a thousand people through its production and supply. Mr. Venkat Ramulu holds a B.Sc and 18 years of experience in the field of herbal products.
