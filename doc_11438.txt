Note: Rain free period / waiting period: 48 hours Parthenium hysterophorus (Parthenium natchu chedi) Manual removal and destruction of Parthenium plants before flowering using hand glouse / machineries (or) Pre-emergence application of atrazine 4 g / litre in 500 litres of water / hectare (or) Uniform spraying of sodium chloride 200g + 2 ml soap oil / litre of water (or) Spraying of 2,4-D sodium salt 8 g or glyphosate 10 ml + 20g ammonium sulphate + 2 ml soap solution / litre of water before flowering (or) Post-emergence application of metribuzin 3 g / litre of water under non crop situation. Raising competitive plants like Cassia serecea and Abutilon indicum on fallow lands to replace Parthenium (or) Biological control by Mexican beetle, fungal pathogen and nematodes Note : Parthenium can be decomposed well before flowering and used as organic manure. Parthenium hysterophorus Solanum elaegnifolium (Kattu Kandan kathiri)         Post-emergence application of Glyphosate 20 ml alone or 10 ml in combination with 2, 4-D sodium salt 6 g / litre. Note: The application should be during the active growth / vegetative phase of weed.       Ipomoea carnea (Neyveli kattamanakku) Foliar application of 2,4-D sodium salt 8 g + urea 20g + soap oil 2 ml / litre of water and then removal and burning of dried weeds (or) Manual / mechanical removal of grownup plants in channels during summer (or) Note : Composted Ipomoea carnea plants can be used as organic manure  preferably in rice fields. Eichhornia crassipes (Agaya thamarai) Manual  / Mechanical removal and drying Application of 2,4-D sodium salt at 8g + urea at 20g or Paraquat at 6 ml / litre of water Note : Vermi-composting and composting of dried water hyacinth and can be used as organic manure in irrigated upland ecosystems.   Portulaca quadrifida (Shiru pasari) Post-emergence tank mix directed application of glyphosate 10 ml/l + 2, 4-D sodium salt 5g / lit to control Portulaca quadrifida in cropped fields. Note: Not to use above herbicides in broadleaved crops particularly cotton and bhendi. Striga asiatica (Sudu malli) Pre-emergence application of atrazine 1.0 kg/ha on 3rd DAP + hand weeding on 45 DAP with an earthing up on 60 DAP combined with post-emergence spraying of 2,4-D at 6 g (0.6%) + urea 20 g (2%) / litre of water on 90 DAP + trash mulching 5 t/ha on 120 DAP.   Orabanche (Pukaielai kalan) Plant hole application of neem cake 25 g / plant or drenching of copper sulphate 5% provides partial control of Orabanche in tobacco.     | Home | Seasons & Varieties | Tillage | Nutrient Management | Irrigation Management | Weed Management | Crop Protection | Cost of Cultivation | © All Rights Reserved.
