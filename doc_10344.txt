Extends assistance in all agriculture avenues Yashpal Morey Eastern Star Consulting Engineers is a Nasik based consultancy for irrigation solutions. It also provides services in the field of agricultural engineering, mainly pipe lines, project report, preparation for bank finance, subsidy proposals for farmers, poly house design, fabrication and erection. It has a sister concern ‘Eastern Star Agro Services’ that offers green houses and shed net houses as per NHB/NHM norms. The company’s timeline since 1980 reflects several achievements. Some of them include: • Cost effective single piston double sprayer developed in ’80s. • Equal and proportionate distribution system • Many pipelines for farmers • Cost effective farm structures coming up soon Eastern Star designs its own equipment that match with the National Horti. Mission / N.H. Board norms. “I am working on cost effective solutions for farm structures, and poly house/ shed net houses are two of those structures. We are designing the same in bamboo structure instead of steel pipes, and it will be very cost effective and affordable to small farmers,” shares Mr. Yashpal Morey, the director of the company. However he adds that acquiring a loan and subsidy for the same will be a challenge since no one has ever tried bamboo structures before. To build up confidence in farmers and bankers, the company will have to show the results by way of pilot projects and subsequent success stories. “We are at present erecting one small 800 sq.m shed net house near Nasik and have an order for one more of 1000 sq.m. In addition we have an order for 1000 sq.m green house. They will serve as pilot projects once erected and will take a year or two to prove their effectiveness,” Mr. More adds. In his previous interview with agricultureinformation.com, Mr. More had mentioned that Eastern Star plans to develop cost effective solutions to modern farming such as porous pipe micro irrigation system, which is a low pressure system that works without any pump set. Porous pipes are now being used in Gujarat effectively. The company recently installed porous pipe system in a 2000 sq.m green house. However, these pipes receive subsidy in Gujarat only. Mr. More believes other states should also provide subsidies for the pipes as they save a lot of power. He believes a lot of electrical energy wastage happens in agriculture. There is no system that can control the pump set horsepower in agriculture. A farmer is at liberty to purchase a higher HP pump set even if he can do with a lower one. He also points out the difficulties that a farmer faces in acquiring bank loans. “This should be simplified and more liberal. Unless you put capital investment, you can’t expect any progress,” he adds. Energy audit is the need of the hour, he points out. In future, Eastern Star Consulting Engineers wishes to develop simple structures in bamboo and bamboo composites. These include poly house and shed net houses, cattle-sheds, poultry sheds, onion storage structures, fencing poles and resin drying sheds.
