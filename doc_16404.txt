Manickam, K. N. Gururajan and N. Gopalakrishnan Central Institute for Cotton Research, Regional Station, Coimbatore, India Abstract Cotton the most important commercial crop of India, often referred as the White Gold, consumes more than 45% of the total pesticides used in our country.  The most important insect pests that affect cotton production are jassids, white fly, aphids and thrips among the sap sucking pests and boll worms (American, Pink and Spotted) and  Spodoptera  among the leaf eating caterpillars.  Of these cotton pests, the American boll worms alone cause yield reduction upto 40 – 70 % under severe incidence.  The genetic resistance, one of the important pest management strategies, is available in cotton gene pool against the sap sucking pests, whereas such resistance is not available against the bollworms.  Hence, an alternate strategy is explored to circumvent this problem by cloning and transferring the genes encoding the toxic crystal δ - endo toxin protein from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis .  The Bt transgenic cotton (Bollgard of Monsanto) has thus been developed successfully in USA, which has the ability to control the bollworms during crop growth effectively. Ever since three Bt cotton hybrids have been approved for commercial cultivation in India during 2002, there was a sharp increase in area under cultivation of such hybrids from a mere 72,000 ac in 2002-03 to 30,00,000 ha in 2006-07.  So far, 59 Bt hybrids have been approved in different cotton growing zones by GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, Government of India) after extensive field trials by All India Coordinated Cotton Improvement Project centres and RCGM trials in farmers’ fields.  Bt cotton hybrids exhibited excellent control of American Boll worm and reduced the use of insecticides leading to create eco-friendly environment without compromising on profitable yield.  As compared to insecticide mediated control of bollworms, Bt cotton technology does not harm non-target beneficial insects; besides reduction in production cost, increase in profit, reduced farming risk and improved economic outlook for cotton are the highlights of this novel technology.  Use of this technology is also helpful in improving wild life population, reduced run-off of insecticides, reduced air pollution and improved safety to farm workers and neighbourhood. Introduction Cotton is the most important commercial crop of our country contributing upto 75% of total raw material needs of textile industry and provides employment to about 60 million people.  India has the largest area under cotton cultivation with relatively low productivity primarily due to the large area under rainfed cultivation with inadequate supply of inputs. Area wise, India ranks first in world, whereas, it ranks second in production next to China.  Only in India, all the four spinnable fibre yielding species of Gossypium viz.,  Gossypium hirsutum, G. barbadense, G. arboreum  and  G. herbaceum  are cultivated commercially.  Hybrid cotton cultivation in about 45% of total cotton area contributing 55% of production is a significant milestone achievement in Indian Cotton scenario.  Qualitative and quantitative transformation has taken place in cotton production in India, since independence.  The production increased from a meager 2.79 million bales of 170 kg each in 1947-48 to a record of 24.0 million bales in 2005-06 (Table 1).   At the time of independence, mostly short and medium staple cottons were produced.  Today, India produces widest range of cottons from 6 to 120s counts, from non-spinnable coarse to medium, long, extra long and superfine cotton.  The cotton productivity reached a plateau of around 300-330 kg lint per hectare during the past one decade, whereas it has been improved to more than 460 kg lint per hectare during the past two years.  Cotton is attacked by several insect pests reducing the crop yield to a greater extent.  The insect pests that attack cotton crop may be classified into sap sucking insects (Aphids, Jassids and White fly) or chewing insects (Bollworms, leaf eating caterpillars etc.).  Of the total pesticides used in Indian Agriculture, about 45 per cent is sprayed on cotton crop alone.  To reduce pesticide usage in cotton, several strategies like use of Genetic Resistance to insect pests, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM) etc. are advocated.  In recent times, Bt cotton technology is found to be one of the best strategies to manage bollworms, the most important pest of cotton. The Need for Bt cotton The genetic resistance, one of the important pest management strategy, is available in cotton gene pool against the sap sucking pests such as jassids, whitefly etc and using this several resistant / tolerant varieties and hybrids have been developed and released in India.  However, such kind of known resistance is not available against the bollworms.  Hence, an alternate strategy is explored to circumvent this problem by cloning and transferring the genes encoding the toxic crystal δ - endo toxin protein from the soil bacterium  Bacillus thuringiensis .  The Bt transgenic cotton (Bollgard of Monsanto) has thus been developed successfully in USA, which has the ability to control the bollworms at the early stages of crop growth (upto 90 days) effectively. The first commercial Bt cotton variety was released in USA by M/S. Monsanto (Bollgard), which contains Cry 1Ac gene of  Bacillus thuringiensis .  Bt cotton is commercially grown in several countries like China, Australia, Mexico, South Africa, Argentina, India, Indonesia etc.  World wide the area under Bt cotton keep increasing year by year.  Overall, about 12% of the world cotton is now planted with Genetically Modified varieties / hybrids (GMO) and ICAC has estimated that his may rise to 50 % in 5-7 years. Chronology of Bt Cotton in India March 10, 1995:  Department of Biotechnology (DBT) of the Government of India permits import of 100 gm of transgenic Cocker-312 variety of cottonseed cultivated in the United States by Mahyco. This variety contained the Cry 1 Ac gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. April 1998:  Monsanto-Mahyco tie up. Monsanto given permission for small trials of Bt cotton 100 g per trial by Department of Biotechnology (DBT). January 8, 1999:  RCGM expresses satisfaction over the trial results at 40 locations and on April 12th directs MAHYCO to submit applications for trials at 10 locations before MEC. 2000-2002:  ICAR trials were conducted at different AICCIP centres of Central and South Zone locations. February 20, 2002:  The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) submits a positive report to the Ministry of Environment on the field trials of Bt cotton. It is now expected that the Genetic Engineering and Approval Committee (GEAC) of the environment ministry will approve commerical use of Bt cotton within a month. March 25, 2002:  Approval given for commercial cultivation to three Bt Cotton hybrids of M/s. MAHYCO by GEAC In India, the area under Bt cotton hybrid has increased from a mere 29,307 ha during 2002 to 12,50,833 ha in 2005.  During 2006, the area has increased upto 30,00,000 ha as projected by seed industry.  The state wise break up of area covered under Bt hybrids are furnished in Table 2.  It is estimated that roughly 40% of total area under cotton hybrids (approximately 100 lakh acres) can potentially be sown under Bt version, which translates into 40 lakh packets every year worth Rs. 640 crore.  So far, 52 different Bt cotton hybrids were released for cultivation in India [Table 3].  Performance of released Bt cotton hybrids in ICAR trials Comparative performance of Bt cotton hybrids developed by different private companies over the year (2001-2005) over different locations of three cotton growing zones of the country indicated superiority of Bt hybrids over their non-Bt counterparts in terms of both yield and contributing characters.  Apart from seed cotton yield, they were also superior in number of bolls/plant, boll weight, seed index, lint index and ginning outturn. The data on fibre quality of these hybrids indicated that there is no significant difference between Bt and non-Bt hybrids for fibre quality parameters  viz ., 2.5 % span length [mm], bundle strength [g/tex] at 3.2 mm gauge, and Micronaire.  When we compare the fibre quality of these hybrids as against the requirements of the mills, as prescribed by South India Mills Association, most of the hybrids are spinnable between 30s and 40s counts. Evaluation in multilocation and large scale field trials Large scale field trial results of four years from 1998 to 2002 indicated that Bt cotton was able to resist bollworm infestations thereby resulting in good boll retention and higher yields. Apart from the increase in yields there was a concomitant reduction in the use of insecticides due to Bt-cotton. Thus it was concluded that Bt-cotton has potential to improve the lives of cotton farmers through the provision of favourable environmental and economic consequences. Bt cotton   vis-à-vis environmental protection Bt cotton cultivars exhibited excellent control of  Helicoverpa zea  and  Heliothis virescens  and reduced impact of insecticides to create eco-friendly environment without compromising yield.  Since the Bt gene is effective during the early phase of crop growth, the bolls produced in the bottom most branches of the plant are retained fully.  The lint obtained from the bottom 1/3rd part of the plant is reported to be of highest quality leading to the production of more quality fibres.  Because of the retention of early formed bolls in the plant, the crop enters into senescence early and matures early compared to non-Bt counterparts.  This ultimately helps in harvesting of seed cotton in two pickings.  The major emphasis was given to the control of boll worms in Bt hybrids as against their non-Bt counterparts by considering the number of times the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) crossed, total number of sprays given for the control of various insect pests under protected and unprotected conditions etc.  In all these aspect, the released Bt cotton hybrids were found to be more efficient as compared to their non-Bt counterparts.  As compared to insecticide control of bollworms, Bt cotton technology will not harm non-target beneficial insects, reduction in production cost, increased profit, reduced farming risk and improved economic outlook for cotton.  Use of this technology is also helpful in improving wild life population, reduced run off insecticides, reduced air pollution and improved safety to farm workers and neighbourhood.    Reduced bollworm damage and reduction in insecticide sprays Almost all the data available in India show that the Bt cotton hybrids crossed ETL for bollworm population in some locations only once after 90 days. Whereas the non-Bt and check hybrids crossed ETL more than three times at different locations from 60 DAS. The population of bollworms especially  Helicoverpa   armigera  was significantly lesser in number in Bt cotton hybrids as compared to non-Bt and check hybrids. Amongst Bt hybrids, MECH-184 and MECH-12 recorded significantly lesser boll and locule damage compared to non-Bt and check hybrids, indicating that the two Bt hybrids exhibited higher tolerance to bollworm damage. There is a 50% overall reduction in the  H. armigera  larval population in Bollgard-MECH-162 compared to the non-Bt MECH-162. Bollgard-MECH-12, Bollgard-MECH-162 and Bollgard-MECH-184 were able to reduce larval populations of spotted bollworm ( Earias vittella ) up to 30-40% and pink bollworm ( Pectinophora gossypiella ) up to 60-80% in south India. Large scale cultivation of Bt cotton has resulted in the significant reduction of insecticide use to the tune of 40 to 60% less than the intensity on the corresponding non-transgenic varieties. Several studies have evaluated the economic benefits accrued due to the cultivation of Bt transgenic cotton versus the corresponding non-transgenic cultivar. Apart from causing a reduction in the usage of insecticides all over the world Bt-cotton has significantly contributed to enhanced yields. Hence it has become very popular in all cotton growing countries of the world. One important advantage of Bt-cotton is that farmers rarely resort to prophylactic spray applications, which they do otherwise, in the absence of Bt-technology. In some regions of the country 7-10 prophylactic sprays per season are common on cotton. The total number of sprays averaged at 16-20 in some districts of Andhra Pradesh and Punjab during 1986-2001. The problem of pest management had become more complex due to bollworm resistance to insecticides, thereby causing enormous wastage of insecticide and subsequent environment pollution. Yield increased substantially by adopting Bt-cotton and farmers in India were able to reduce at least 2-3 insecticide applications. Over the past four years bollworm infestation in India was low, thus reducing the need for insecticide applications. However, the benefits of Bt-cotton were more in other countries where bollworm infestation was high. Insecticide applications on Bt-cotton varieties were reduced up to 14 applications in China, 7 in South Africa and 5-6 in Indonesia and Australia (Table 5). Biosafety tests and assessment of toxicity to non-target organisms Biosafety tests indicated absolute safety to goats, cows, buffaloes, fish and poultry. Feed-safety studies with Bt cottonseed meal were carried out with goats, buffalos, cows, rabbits, birds and fish. The results revealed that the animals fed with Bt-cotton seed meal were comparable to the control animals in various tests and showed no ill-effects. These studies were carried out by the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal; Central Avian Research Institute, Bareily; Industrial Toxicological Research Centre, Lucknow; National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad; Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai and GB Pant University for Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar. The Cry1Ac is mainly toxic to the bollworms (cotton bollworm, pink bollworm and spotted bollworm), semiloopers and hairy caterpillars. Bt-cotton expressing Cry1Ac is absolutely non-toxic to all other non-target organisms such as beneficial insects, birds, fish, animals and human beings. Laboratory and field studies carried out in India showed that the Cry1Ac protein deployed in Bt-cotton did not have any direct effect on any of the non-target beneficial insects. Work carried out elsewhere in the world also showed similar results. There was some evidence of a reduction in numbers of predators and parasitoids which specialise on the Bt controlled bollworms, but also of increases in numbers and diversity of generalist predators such as spiders. Generally the decrease in the parasitoid and predator populations were associated with decrease in the densities of the pest populations on account of Bt-cotton. Due to these changes in pest complex, farmers had to spray 3-5 times on bollgard as compared to 6-8 times on non-Bt cottons. Any effects could be assigned to the decrease in prey quality – for example with stunted  Spodoptera litura  caterpillars which had fed on Bt cotton. In the field situation, partial life studies broadly confirmed this finding. There was no increase in green vegetable bug numbers, aphid or whitefly numbers on Bt cotton. In general, such adverse effects as have been measured are very small when compared with the side effects of the spraying of conventional insecticides.   Post release field performance and enhanced economic benefits Results from extensive Bt cotton trials under farmer field conditions, conducted from 1998 to 2001 confirmed that Bt cotton with the Cry1 Ac gene provides effective and safe control of bollworm and related pests. Field trials have confirmed that, compared to conventional hybrids, Bt cotton can increase yields by up to at least 40%, reduce insecticide sprays by at least 50 % or more (decrease from 7 to 2 or 3 sprays on average) equivalent to savings of Rs 2500/hectare, and increase overall farmer income from Bt cotton from Rs 3500 to Rs 10,000 or more per hectare. Mahyco commissioned a nationwide survey by ACNeilsen-ORG MARG in 2003. The survey covered 3,063 from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat (Table 6). The data showed that a yield increase by about 29% (range 18 to 40%) due to effective control of bollworms, a reduction in chemical sprays by 60% (range 51 to 71%) and an increase in net profit by 78% (range 66 to 164%) as compared to non-Bt cotton. The net profit was estimated to an average of Rs.7,724 (range Rs. 5,900 to 12,696) per hectare. Mahyco conducted an independent survey during 2003 to assess the performance of Bt-cotton in fields of 3000 farmers. Results showed an average net profit of Rs 18,325 (range 15,854 to 20,196) per hectare. Field trials conducted by Mahyco during 2001, in 157 farms in 25 districts of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamilnadu showed that there were no changes in the insecticide use for sucking pest control, but at least three sprayings meant for bollworm control were saved due to the Bt-technology. Thus, insecticide use of cotton bollworm was reported to have been reduced by 83% and yield increase by a staggering 80%. Global estimates show that, Bt cotton caused an average net income increase of $ US 50/hectare in the USA, $357/hectare to $549/hectare in China and $25-51/hectare in South Africa.  Opportunities for the future Keeping in mind the development of resistance to Cry 1Ac protein in insects, notable progress has already been made to diversify the transgene and to pyramid genes which are having different mode of action so that development of resistance is delayed.  The genes available for exploitation include Bollgard II of Monsanto (Cry 1Ac + Cry 2Ab), VIP COT of Syngenta (VIP 3A) and Wide Strike of Dow Agro Sciences (Cry 1Ac + Cry 1F).  The problem with regard to fibre quality of Bt hybrid as noted in MECH. 12 and MECH. 184 may be circumvented by involving a proper combination of parents to produce superior Bt cotton hybrid for both yield as well as fibre quality.  Table 1.
