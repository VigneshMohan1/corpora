Top The National Population Register (NPR) is a Register of usual residents of the country. It is being prepared at the local (Village level), sub District (Tehsil/Taluk level), District, State and National level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. 2. What are the objectives of the schemes? Top The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database in the country with full identification and other details by registering each and every usual resident in the country. This would help in better targeting the benefits and services under the Government schemes/programmes, improve planning and prevent identity fraud. 3. What are the legal provisions under which the NPR is being created? Top The Citizenship Act 1955 was amended in 2004 by inserting Section 14A which provides for the following:- (1) The Central Government may compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue National Identity Card. (2) The Central Government may maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and for that purpose establish a National Registration Authority. (3) On and from the date of commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, the Registrar General, India, appointed under sub-section     (1) of section 3 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 (18 of 1969) shall act as the National Registration Authority and he shall function as            the Registrar General of Citizen Registration. (4) The Central Government may appoint such other officers and staff as may be required to assist the Registrar General of Citizen Registration in discharging his functions and responsibilities. (5) The procedure to be followed in compulsory registration of the citizens of in India shall be such as may be prescribed. 4. What are the procedures to be followed for creating the NPR? Top The procedures to be followed for creating the NPR have been laid down in the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. Rule 3(4): The Central Government may, by an order issued in this regard, decide a date by which the population register shall be prepared by collecting information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of local registrar. Rule 4(1): The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status. 5. Is it necessary to register for the NPR? Top It is compulsory for every citizen of the country to register in a National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) as per Section 14A of the Citizenship Act 1955 as amended in 2004. The NPR is the first step towards preparation of the NRIC. Out of the universal data set of residents, the subset of citizens would be derived after due verification of the citizenship status. Therefore it is compulsory for all usual residents to register under the NPR. 6. How a person can be registered in NPR? Top During the first phase of Census 2011 (in the month of April 2010-September 2010), enumerators have visited every household and have collected the details required for the NPR in a paper format. These forms have been scanned and the data has been entered into an electronic database. Biometric attributes- photograph, fingerprints and two iris prints are being added to the database by organizing enrolment camps in each local area. The enrolment will be done in the presence of Government servants appointed for this purpose. 7. What details the NPR will contain. Top The NPR would have the following details of every usual resident in the country (i) Name of Person, (ii) Relationship to head, (iii) Fatherâ€™s name, (iv) Motherâ€™s name (v) Spouseâ€™s name (if married), (vi) Sex, (vii) Date of Birth, (viii) Marital Status, (ix) Place of Birth, (x) Nationality as declared, (xi) Present address of usual residence, (xii) Duration of stay at present address, (xiii) Permanent residential address, (xiv) Occupation/ Activity, (xv) Educational qualification Also, three biometrics namely photograph, 10 finger prints and 2 iris would be collected for persons of age 5 years and above. 8. Will Non Resident Indians (NRI) be part of the NPR? Top By definition, an NRI is not a usual resident of the country. Therefore, they would not be in the NPR till they are non residents. When they come back to India and take up usual residence within the country, they will be included in the NPR. 9. What records will be required to register for NPR? Top The individual details have already been collected during house to house visit by the enumerator. An Acknowledgement slip has also been given. This Acknowledgement slip should be carried to the enrolment camp. In case an intimation slip has been issued, that should be filled in and carried to the camp. No other records are required. 10. What is to be done if the Acknowledgement slip is not available / lost? Top The office copy of the Acknowledgement slip will be available at the camp with the officials concerned. The relevant slip will have to be searched out in such cases. 11. How will the public know about these camps? Top Publicity will be made in the local area regarding the duration and location of the enrolment camp for capturing of biometrics. Intimation slips will also be distributed house to house before the setting up of such camps wherever possible. The venue, date & time of biometrics will also be mentioned in it. 12. What is to be done if an individual misses the camp? Top Two camps will be held in every local area. If an individual misses the first camp, intimation will be given to attend the second camp. In case second camp is also missed, chance will be given to enroll at camps that would be set up at the sub-district level until the designated date. After the designated date, the individuals name will be struck off from the NPR. 13. What is to be done if the household has not been covered in the NPR or if the individual has changed residence? Top A new form will have to be filled up at the camp. These forms will be verified by the authorities and the individuals details will be captured during the next camp. 14. Is there any penalty for providing wrong information willfully or otherwise? Top Providing any false information would attract penalties under Citizenship Rules 2003. 15. Is any payment required for enrolment under NPR? Top The enrolment will be done free of cost. No payment of any kind should be made to anybody for this purpose. In case any money is asked for any reason, the matter should be reported to the local authorities. Complaints can also be registered over the e mail and over phone. 16. Will Identity Cards be issued under the NPR? Top A proposal to issue Resident Identity Cards to all usual residents in the NPR of 18 years of age and above is under consideration of the Government. This Card would be a smart Card and would bear the Aadhaar number. 17. How will the data collected for NPR be authenticated? Top The biographic data has been collected by a Government servant at the doorstep of the individual. The biometrics have also been collected in the presence of the government servant after verification of the Acknowledgement slip. After this, the biographic data along with the photograph and Aadhaar number will be displayed in the local area for inviting claims and objections. The lists will also be scrutinized by the local officials. These lists would also be placed in the Gram Sabhas and Ward Committees. This process of social audit would bring in transparency and equity. 18. What is the connection between NPR and Aadhaar (UID Number)? Top The NPR is a register of usual residents. The data collected in NPR will be sent to UIDAI for de-duplication and issue of Aadhaar Number. Thus the register will contain three elements of data â€“ (i) demographic data, (ii) biometric data and (iii) the Aadhaar (UID Number). 19. Does a person who has already enrolled with some other Registrar of UIDAI still have to register under NPR? Top Yes. Under the NPR, certain processes like the collection of data at the doorstep of the individual by authorized persons, collection of biometrics after following a certain process, authentication through social audit, verification by Local authorities etc are mandatory. Thus, a person who has already enrolled with some other Registrar will have to get registered under NPR again. 20. Who are the authorities which can be contacted for re-dressel of complaint or for getting clarification? Top A proper administrative hierarchy has been provided under NPR. At the village level, it is local village officer, at Tehsil/ Taluk level, it is Tehsildar/ Mamlatdar/ Sub-district officer and at the District level, it is District Magistrate/ Collector/ Deputy Commissioner. In each State/ UT, Director of Census Operations would co-ordinate all the matters relating to creation of NPR.
