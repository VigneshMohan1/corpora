The Bt cotton (Bollgard) was approved by the Government of India in 2002.  The area has steadily increased over the last six year and occupies more than 75% of the cotton growing areas.  With the adoption of Bt cotton, the production has risen from an average 150 lakh bales in 2002 to 270 lakh bales in 2007. The yield has also shot up from 300 kg per hectare to 500 kg.  As a result India has become the number two cotton producer in the world.
