In order to consolidate gains made during Phase-I, Phase-II has been initiated from December 2006 with an allocation of Rs 914.89 crore. The NPCBB envisages genetic upgradation on priority basis with a focus on development and conservation of important indigenous breeds. The project envisages 100% grant-in-aid to Implementing Agencies. 1.1  Objectives   The objectives of the scheme are: (i)        to arrange delivery of vastly improved artificial insemination (AI) service at the farmers’ doorstep; (ii)       bring all breedable females among cattle and buffalo under organized breeding through artificial insemination or natural service by high quality bulls  within a period of 10 years; (iii)      undertake breed improvement programme for indigenous cattle and buffaloes so as to improve  the genetic  makeup as well as their availability. 1.2  Components (a)               streamlining storage and supply of Liquid Nitrogen by sourcing supply from industrial gas manufacturers and setting up bulk transport and storage systems for the same, (b)               3 photo introduction of quality bulls with high genetic merit, (c)                promotion of private mobile AI service for doorstep delivery of AI, (d)              conversion of existing stationary government A.I. centres into mobiles centres, (e)               quality control and certification  of  bulls and services at sperm stations, semen banks and training institutions, (f)                 induction of breeding bulls for natural service in the areas not under AI coverage , and (g)               institutional restructuring by way of entrusting the job of managing production and supply of genetic inputs as well as Liquid Nitrogen to a specialized autonomous and professional State Implementing Agency. 1.3       Constitution of State Implementing Agencies (SIAs)   3.3.4.1 Since inception of the project in October, 2000, 27 SIAs have been constituted under the project in 28 States. These agencies have professional approach in implementing the project.  In case of small States, which are unable to constitute viable SIAs, funds have been released to the State Governments for implementation of the project. 1.4       Progress of the Scheme At present 28 States and one UT are participating in the project. Financial assistance to the tune of Rs 875.72 crore has been released to these States/UT up to 2011-12. During the financial year 2012-13 (till 30 th  September 2012), an amount of Rs 69.52 crore has been spent. 1.5       The notable achievements under NPCBB since inception are: i)                    Semen production increased from 22 to 63 million doses & number of AI increased from 21.80 to 52 million (21 million animals under AI coverage). Semen production has increased from 50.5 million to 62 million and AI number from 50 million to 52 million between 2009-10 and 2010-11. Conception rate increased from 20% to 35%; ii)                   36000 Government Stationary AI centres have been converted into mobile AI centres; iii)                 21000 Private AI centres have been established or under establishment. 4000 private AI workers has been established between 2009-10 and 2010-11;   iv)                 21700 breeding bulls with high genetic merit have been inducted or under induction. 3000 quality breeding bulls have been inducted for natural service between 2009-10 and 2010-11. v)                  50,000 existing AI workers have been trained in all the aspects of frozen semen technology (including funds released for training of existing AI workers during current year);  vi)                 1800 professionals have been trained outside the State at reputed training centres; vii)               49 frozen semen bull station have been strengthened as per Minimum Standard Protocol (MSP) for semen production; viii)              in order to improve quality of semen production in the country MSP for semen production has been formulated and implemented at all semen station in the country; ix)                 Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) has been constituted for evaluation of semen stations one in two years and implementation of Minimum Standard Protocol (MSP) for semen production in the country, x)                  22 semen stations are graded as ‘A’, 17 as ‘B’ and 3 as ‘C’ during 2010-11 against 11 as ‘A’, 16 as ‘B’ and 7 as ‘C’ during 2007-08. A and B graded semen station has increased to 37 against 27 in earlier evaluation. xi)                 34 semen stations in the country have acquired ISO certification against 3 during 2004; xii)               Number of animals in milk has increased from 62 million during 2000 to 77 million during 2008 i.e. about 14 million  improved milch animals has been added to milch herd of the country; xiii)              Crossbred cattle population has increased from 20 million (1997) to 33 million (2007) and xiv)             MSP (Minimum Standard Protocol) for progeny testing and standard operating procedures for AI (artificial insemination) technicians has been formulated and circulated among all the States. 1.6       The performance of AI centres  and Semen stations are given in Table 1 and 2 Table 1 :  Performance of AI Centres Agency No of AIC AI       (Million) No of AI             (per year) Government 48,000 35.00 555 Private AI workers 15,000 Cooperative 15,000 14.5 966 NGO 6,000  2.5 416 Total 84000 52.00 619   Table 2:  Performance of Semen Stations Agency Semen Stations No of Bulls Semen Production  (million) Bulls  per  Station Doses Produced per Station (lakh) Government 37 2029 31.59 54 8.54 NDDB, Dairy Coop, NGO and Private 11 1292 30.37 117 27.60 Total 48 3321 61.96 69 12.91 1.6       Liquid Nitrogen (LN) Transport and distribution system:             Before initiation of NPCBB, small stand alone plants were used by the State Departments of Animal Husbandry and most of the plants were facing frequent breakdowns. The unit cost of production was very high ranging from ` 30 to ` 35 per litre. Concept of procurement of liquid nitrogen from private sources was introduced for the first time in the country under NPCBB. The unit cost of liquid nitrogen procured from private sources is in the range of Rs 6 to Rs 10 per litre. Under the scheme, LN storage, transport and distribution system has been strengthened and streamlined through establishment of semen banks and silos at strategic locations and providing vehicles for distribution of LN up to AI centres.    Semen Production in the country has increased from 22 million straws  (1999-2000) to 63 million straws (2010-2011) and the number of inseminations has increased from 20 million to 52 million. As per the impact analysis report submitted by NABARD, overall consumption rate has increased from 20 % to 35 % 1.7       Evaluation of semen stations: In order to attain qualitative and quantitative improvement in semen production, Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) was constituted on 20.5.2004 by the Department for evaluation and grading of semen stations once in two years. The CMU has since undertaken evaluation on four occasions. Improvement in grading of semen stations after constitution of CMU is presented in table 3 and state wise grading of semen station is given at table 4.

Under NPCBB, 50,000 existing AI workers and 1800 professionals have been trained. This has led to improvement in quality of breeding services. Development and conservation of recognised indigenous breeds: Indigenous breeds are specially known for qualities of heat tolerance, resistance to diseases and ability to thrive under extreme nutritional stress.   Considering the importance of recognized indigenous breeds in the National economy, Government has undertaken the following steps for their development and conservation: National Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding has focus on development and conservation of indigenous breeds. The cattle and buffalo genetic resources of India are represented by  34 indigenous breeds of cattle including Rathi, Gir, Kankrej, Tharparkar, Sahiwal, Deoni, Hallikar, Khillar Hariana etc. and 11 breeds of buffaloes including Murrah, Jaffarabadi, Mehsani, Surti etc. Indigenous animals are sturdy, endowed with quality of heat tolerance, resistance to diseases and have ability to thrive under extreme nutritional stress. Global warming is likely to increase incidences of animal diseases particularly viral and protozoan diseases in crossbred animals. Therefore, there is a need to take programmes for development and conservation of indigenous breeds. Funds have been released to the participating States for procurement of quality bulls for natural service, initiating bull production programmes, strengthening of bull mother farms and establishment of ONBS farms for important indigenous breeds (Bhadawari, Sahiwal, Gir, Deoni, Kankrej, Hariana, Kenkatha, Hallikar, Khillar, etc.) for their further development. During Phase-I of the project an amount of ` 58 crore has been released exclusively for development and conservation of indigenous breeds. An amount of ` 477.30 crore has been kept exclusively for development of indigenous breeds under Phase-II of NPCBB. Out of this, an expenditure of Rs 250 crore has been made under the scheme till March 2012.  In addition to this, strengthening of field AI network, semen stations, establishment of private AI workers and organization of fertility camps etc have also lead to development of indigenous breeds.   Help | Terms of Use | Site Map | Accessibility Statement | Disclaimer | Hyperlinking Policy | Privacy Policy | Archives | Contact Us This website belongs to Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. ©  2014 All rights reserved.
