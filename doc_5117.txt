The species is broadly adapted and extremely common throughout Florida, and its perennial nature assures a stellar performance year after year. Although lemon bacopa can be weedy in some situations, it is most often considered a beneficial native plant that brings a number of desirable characteristics to almost any aquatic setting.

To assist local pepper growers in maintaining crop productivity and improving the quality of produce, this publication illustrates common pests including major diseases and insects and recommends Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, including host resistance, cultivation, sanitation, and physical, mechanical, biological, and chemical approaches, for effective pest management.

Anyone storing pesticides, especially in the presence of children, needs to take precautions by keeping them in their proper, original containers. Several people have died when they unknowingly drank pesticides from containers that originally held soda, other beverages, or foodstuffs. In particular, the herbicide paraquat is highly toxic to humans; one small accidental sip can be fatal, and there is no antidote.

The information in this article is intended to provide insight regarding the potential benefits and limitations of these technologies so that firms in the food industry can make more informed decisions on which technologies should be incorporated into their own systems and to what degree.

However, as a relatively new commercial crop to Florida, the cultural requirements of these trees are not completely known and research is ongoing to understand how to manage them for plant health and fruit yield as well as to make recommendations on varietal selections best suited to the southeastern region of the United States. This 5-page fact sheet includes culture and management information, selected references, and a table listing a selection of olive cultivars currently available in the U.S. Written by Mack Thetford, Jennifer L. Gillett-Kaufman, Michael J. Mulvaney, and published by the UF Department of Environmental Horticulture, February 2015. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ep515 Effects of Harvest Method on Microclimate in Florida Sugarcane The production systems for sugarcane include either green cane or burnt cane harvesting operations. Sugarcane in Florida is typically harvested with burnt cane mechanical harvesting, but there is a growing interest to better understand the effects of green cane harvest residue “trash blankets” on microclimate conditions for sugarcane growing on both organic and mineral soils of Florida, so the authors conducted a three-year study to determine the effects of each harvest method on microclimate within the surface soil profile and at a 10 cm height from the soil surface. Results are presented in this 4-page fact sheet written by Hardev Sandhu, Maninder Singh, Robert Gilbert, Kelly Morgan, Ronald Rice, Leslie Baucum, James Shine Jr., and Mike Irey, and published by the UF Department of Agronomy, April 2015.

Most current models capture the biophysics of moisture and energy transport and of crop growth and development pretty well. However, model estimates of soil moisture in the root zone diverge from reality due to accumulated errors in initialization, forcings, and computation. Remotely sensed microwave observations can be assimilated into these models to improve root zone soil moisture and crop yield estimates. This 100-page report describes the observations conducted during a season-long experiment in elephant grass and sweet corn using active and passive microwave observations.

But management decisions must be based on high-quality observations. Sensors must meet accepted minimum accuracy standards, the station must be sited properly and well-maintained. This 5-page fact sheet provides farmers with basic guidelines for installing and maintaining a weather station. Written by Clyde W. Fraisse, George W. Braun, William R. Lusher, and Lee R.

When the plants cannot take up water and nutrients from the soil, they become stunted, wilt, and with severe infestation, die. Florida is considered to be the point-of-origin for Belonolaimus longicaudatus and therefore this nematode exhibits a great deal of diversity in morphology, host preference, and genetics in our region.

It is a solitary, internal parasitoid and lays one egg per host, with the larva developing inside the host’s body. The wasps may be commercially reared and distributed inside mummies, and they will emerge within 1-5 days after delivery. Application involves placing a bottle containing the mummies in a dry spot of the crop and allowing the adults to emerge. This 5-page fact sheet was written by Theresa Chormanski and Ronald D.

In 2012, Dr. John Hafernik and his colleagus at San Francisco State University discovered that Apocephalus borealis also parasitizes honey bees. Parasitized honey bees show zombie-like behavior by leaving their hives at night and are often attracted to nearby lights where they show disoriented behavior and die in a few hours.

Extension values its relationship with the schools and welcomes the opportunity to provide research-based curricula for classroom use. This 8-page fact sheet includes a desciption of 4-H School Enrichment and its benefits, procedures for starting and scheduling a program, resources and guidelines, and tips for promoting involvement to other 4-H programs. Adapted for use in Florida by Tracy A. Tesdall and published by the UF Department of 4-H Youth Development, April 2015. http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/4h324 Health Benefits and Medicinal Value of Honey Honey has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years. It is rich in sugars such as glucose and fructose, but it also contains small amounts of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and antioxidants such as phenolic acids and flavonoids. These nutrients help to make honey a unique, natural health product. Its market niche as a health product is growing, and current research supports the potential of honey as a medicinal product. This 3-page fact sheet describes health aspects of honey deriving from the floral source and color, beneficial compounds, anti-microbial properties and anti-inflammatory properties.

These organisms have a protective covering that makes them resistant to disinfectants and that gives Cyclospora the ability to survive outside of hosts for extended periods. The incidence of cyclosporiasis has been increasing worldwide, with several documented cases in the United States and Canada. This 4-page fact sheet was written by Keith R.
