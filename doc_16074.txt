Programme/Schemes administered by the Credit Division National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) A Central Sector Scheme namely, National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) is being implemented in the country since Rabi 1999-2000, as a part of risk management in agriculture with the intention of providing financial support to the farmers in the event of failure of crops as a result of natural calamities, pests and diseases. The scheme is available to all the farmers – loanee and non-loanee - irrespective of their size of holding. Loanee farmers are covered on compulsory basis in a notified area for notified crops whereas for non-loanee farmers scheme is voluntary. 2. The Scheme envisages coverage of all the food crops (cereals, millets and pulses), oilseeds and annual commercial/horticultural crops, in respect of which past yield data is available for adequate number of years. Crops covered by the implementing States/UTs during Kharif and Rabi seasons under NAIS are at Annexure-I . The premium rates are ranging between 1.5% and 3.5% per cent (of sum insured) for food and oilseed crops. In the case of commercial/horticultural actuarial rates are being charged. Under the scheme, at present, 10% subsidy in premium is available to small & marginal farmers. 3. It is a yield guarantee scheme operating on “Area approach” basis. The implementing States/UTs can notify any unit area of insurance i.e. block, mandal, tehsil, circle, phirka, gram panchayat etc. keeping in view the availability of past yield data and capacity of the State to undertake requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs). The State Government/UT Administration is required to notify areas/crops well in advance of the each crop season and issued the necessary notification/instructions to all financial institutes. Provide past yield data and also conduct the required number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in each notified areas for assessment of crop loss. 4. If the actual average yield per hectare of the insured crop for the defined area (on the basis of requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments) in the insured season, falls short of specified Threshold yield, all the insured farmers growing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall in their yield and the scheme provides coverage against such contingency. The indemnity claims are worked out by the Implementing Agency i.e. Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) of India Ltd., on the basis of yield data, based on requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments, furnished by the implementing State/UT. The claims are released to banks and the banks in turn credit the amount in the account of the beneficiary farmers and display the particulars of beneficiaries on their notice board. 5. Indemnity claims are worked out as per the following formula: Shortfall in yield _____________ X Sum Insured for the farmer Threshold Yield (Shortfall = Threshold Yield – Actual Yield for the Defined Area). 6. Financial liabilities towards claims beyond 100% of premium in case of Food Crops & Oilseeds alongwith 10% premium subsidy to small and marginal farmers, Bank Service charges and 20% of A&O Expenses is to be borne by the Government and are shared on 50:50 basis by the Central Government and the respective State Government. The claims in case of annual horticultural/commercial crops and expended coverage (beyond 100% of sum insured) of Food Crops & Oilseeds, for which actuarial premium is being charged, is to be borne by Implementing Insurance Company. 7. The scheme is optional for States/UTs. At present, the scheme is being implemented by the 24 States and 2 Union Territories namely Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Orissa, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andman & Nicobar Islands and Puducherry. The scheme is demand driven. However, the progress of the scheme can be measured in terms of farmers/area covered, sum insured, premium collected, claims paid and farmers benefitted. State-wise/season-wise business statistics of NAIS are at Annexure-II & III . 8. Financial progress of the scheme from X Five Year Plan is as under:- (Rs. in crores) Year B.E. R.E.
