Motivates farmers to produce and website would sell Santosh Patil Vegwala.com is an innovative website developed by Mr. Santosh Patil and his wife. The website eliminates middlemen between farmers and customers and enables easy shopping of groceries. The company was registered under the name Mitera Agrotech in 2010 with 2 directors. Mr. and Mrs. Patil started the modest company with their own savings to bring a change in the current system. First, they took a step to eliminate middlemen from the system by bringing fresh farm produce directly to customers through vegwala.com. It currently has around 5000+ customers online and does close to Rs. 1 crore of business yearly. “We focused on the framework to create demand. Now we know our customers and their demands,” shares Mr. Patil. The company has in-built analytic which predicts the demand. This helps them work with farmers directly. The requirement is conveyed to the farmers, and they harvest accordingly. Vegwala supplies fresh fruits and vegetables at the customer’s door step. All the produce is procured from farmers close to Bangalore and Hoskote. Farmers were initially hesitant to associate themselves with Vegwala as they were not sure of continuous demand from the website. The company was also very specific about the quality of produce. Farmers took some time to get adjusted to their model but are now happy as they get better prices without the involvement of middlemen. “We are working towards providing better solution in agriculture domain to help our farmers too. So it’s going to be end to end framework,” Mr. Patil adds. With mutual procedure and understanding, any farmer can be associated with the company. It currently has 150 farmers in its framework. Currently they give the company a small portion of their yields as per quality standards. It wishes to grow to a level where it can buy all their harvest. The website has four delivery slots, i.e., 10-12, 12-2, 3-5 and 6-8. On days when the produce is left over after the last click of the day, the surplus is either sold to small vendors or employees of the company at the same price of purchase from farmers. A portion of surplus is also donated to an old age home nearby. Speaking of his swift movement from software to agriculture, Mr. Patil says, coming from an agricultural background the movement was effortless for him. “More and more farmers are quitting farming and moving to cities for jobs. If this continues, soon there will be no one doing farming. India as a country has fixed landmarks for farming, and it is shrinking very rapidly. This is going to be the biggest problem in near future,” he points out. He further believes that now is the right time for any entrepreneur to think of innovation in agri sector by bringing technology in farming, demand and supply transparency and good agri practices. With use of technology one can optimize crop yield and maintain proper demand supply ratio. That’s where Mitera Agrotech as a company wishes to bring the change in the current system. Being very specific about the quality of its products, Vegwala aims to continue focusing only on fruits, vegetables and small portion of dairy. “We are motivating farmers to the basic profession of India. Our future plan is to expand the business plan in Bangalore and then hopefully to other cities soon,” Mr. Patil adds. Mr. Patil holds a Bachelor’s degree of engineering computer science. He has twelve years’ of experience in agriculture.
