Nonetheless, the craze and excitement surrounding the sport in India is such that one cannot remain detached for a very long time from the virus which sends people in a mode when they absolutely refuse to eat anything unless the team emerges victorious, when they sit glued to a position, fearing their moving an inch would somehow affect the Indian team's position negatively and when they shout at the top of their voices at the fall of opposite team's wicket or when one of an Indian Player hits a six at a crucial moment in the match. What is surprising is that the neighbours, who otherwise have a problem even at the sound of the drop of a needle, have absolutely no problem with their screams, instead this time they will be joining in the madness. Thus, all those news channels stating cricket unites people of India like nothing else actually talk sense. It is not that cricket has been the favourite sport of Indians ever since they were exposed to it. Earlier, sports like hockey and Kabbadi were more popular in India. Cricket has come up a long way to a point when it enjoys an unparalleled fan following as a sport. The excellent performance of Indian cricketers at an international platform is one of the major factors that contribute to the popularity of the sport. India has made its presence felt at important times on the international platform and has even dominated it on many occasions. Cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Saurav Ganguly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and many more, the title of World Champions in 1983 an d 2011, the victory at maiden 20-20 World Cup, the honour of defeating countries like England, Australia and South Africa at their home grounds on several occasions are events that qualify and justify the claim of cricket as numero uno sport in India.
