Focused on growing fruits and vegetables V Ravikumar Lake Forest Farmtech was established in Feb 2007. It is located in a place called Berigai in Krishnagiri district. Four software professionals, Mr. V Ravikumar, Mr. B. K. Ravishankar, Mr. Gratian Perez and Mr. R. Rammurthi hoping to make a mark in something different, got together to start the farm. Having been in the software industry for quite some time, the group decided to change their field. Inherent passion and interest towards farming and agriculture led them to the establishment of the farm. They are now pursuing both software and farming simultaneously. Their long term goal is to get into agriculture full time in the next two years. The farm is involved in both organic and integrated farming. It grows orchards of mango, pomegranate, sapota, guava, amla and papaya. Vegetables growing in the farm include radish, okra, brinjal, and flowers include the likes of marigold. Since it is an integrated farm, cattle are reared for fertilizer. The farm has around 15 cows now. The orchard is grown on 65 acres. The farm has planted around 8000 orchard plants since 2007. All of them have reached the yielding stage now. Besides orchard, cash crops like ragi, vegetables, and flowers depending on the season and the demand in the local market are also grown. This is done mainly to sustain the mango trees in the farm that produce around 15 to 18 tons of fruits every year. A few tamarind trees in the farm give around 2 tons of tamarind every year. Other orchard plants, vegetables, and flowers give an income of around Rs. 35 to 40 thousand every month. “It is just a beginning for us, and we believe that our efforts will start giving more results in the years to come. We are currently focusing only on fruits and vegetables, though we have plans to do lot more once we get in full time into this activity,” Mr. V Ravikumar adds. The farm believes in 100 percent organic farming, and hence no chemical of any kind is used. Only vermicompost, neem oil, and panchagavya are used on the plants. EM solution is used to protect the crops from diseases and to increase the yield. These inputs have been giving the farm good results with consistent usage over a period of time. Methods to conserve water and to make the most of resources within the farm are also implemented. The farm generates enough cow dung and other organic wastes, which are converted into vermicompost. Thus its dependency on any external resources is very less. The intent behind such practices is to reduce the cost of cultivation and improve the margin of produce. “Our farm is in a semi-arid zone. Hence our first aim was to construct a lot of ponds, swails and check dams across the entire farm to preserve and conserve water,” says Mr. Ravikumar. The farm has 3 bore wells. It thus aims at generating good yields with adequate water and simple cultivation practices. All the produce are currently sold in the local market close to the farm. The founders plan to directly deliver the goods at the door steps of consumers when they dedicate themselves to farming completely. “We plan to target niche customers who are in gated community compounds or in multi-storied apartments. Typically, they need to plan a lot to buy and stock vegetables and fruits for a week. Instead we would plan for them and deliver them at their door steps. This will help them get good quality organic goods without much of an effort from their side,” Mr. Ravikumar shares. Though they do not get good prices for their produce in the local market, they hope to see improved margins with the implementation of “Farm to Home” in the future. Apart from being involved in farming, the founders educate about organic farming in the local farming area. However, many farmers lack the required sustenance and resort to easy and quick money approach. The four are however confident of creating the necessary awareness in the neighborhoods. The farm’s future plan is to implement the concept “Farm to Home” in its true spirit. It plans to use simple and user-friendly order management techniques to achieve this. “Our goal is to create good awareness among people on the benefits of consumption of organic produce and educate them on the value of health,” Mr. Ravikumar says as he signs off. Mr. Ravikumar is a postgraduate in science. He started his career in a bank in the 1988 and moved to IT in 1995 when the IT field began to blossom. All other partners also have a similar background.
