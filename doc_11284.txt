Go to the shop Vedic Organic Certification Agency Home Vedic Organic Certification Agency Plans to be accredited for JAS, EU standards like have successful authorization for NPOP and NOP Dr.M.Usha Vedic Organic Certification Agency was established in 2008 at Hyderabad. Mrs. P. Sudha Reddy and Mrs. M. Usha are the founders. The agency provides organic certification as per Indian standards-NPOP and also as per US standards-NOP. Since 2011, Tracenet has been introduced where the entire process from registration to generation of organic certificate is done online through the software developed by APEDA. Organic certification is given for the scopes of crop production, food processing, trading, and wild collection. Certification can be obtained by farmers, processors, as well as traders. “In India there are 24 certification bodies accredited by APEDA for the purpose of providing organic certification. All of them are equal. They are spread over all the states. The farmer can select the certification body close to him,” shares Dr. Usha. Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Orissa are the states where the company has its main operations. After the farmer registers with the certification body, Inspection is carried out during the crop season and certificate is issued which needs to be renewed annually. For the first two years the status of the farm is given as first year conversion and second year conversion respectively. In the third year the organic status is given to annuals and biennials and in the fourth year organic status is given to the perennials. Depending on the conversion status, the premium is given to farmers. First and second year produce gets less premium-about 5-10%. For organic status, the farmer can obtain a 20% premium. When the farmer sells his produce in large quantities, he needs to take a transaction certificate from the CB for every transaction. This is required to keep track of his actual production and actual sales that is being carried out by him. Transaction certificates help in checking of any fraud that can take place. Andhra Pradesh agriculture department has allotted eleven districts to Vedic Organic Certification Agency for organic certification. “Similarly we have worked with Haryana state horticulture mission and now we are also working with organic farming authority of Jharkhand,” Dr. Usha further adds. In future, the company wishes to be accredited for other standards such as JAS, EU etc., just like it has successfully accredited for NPOP and NOP. “We also are looking to build a good client base throughout the country and get a good recognition to Vedic organic certification agency,” concludes Dr. Usha. She holds B.Sc degree in Microbiology from Nizam College, Hyderabad, and M.Sc Biochemistry from Hyderabad Central University, and also Ph.D from JNTU in organic chemistry.
