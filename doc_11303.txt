Also involved in calf rearing V.K.Sudharsan Yoogakshema Orchards is located near Tindivanam in Tiruvannamalai district, Tamil Nadu. There are three farms in three different locations. In 11 acres, the farm grows mango and coconut, in 22 acres vegetables are grown, and in 3 acres, calf rearing is done. Mr. Sudharsan, a designated partner, leads these activities. The newly acquired Yoogakshema Orchards has 22 acres, where 2 acres are dedicated to moringa, 2 for brinjal, 2 for bitter gourd, 2 for snake gourd, 1 acre for ladies finger, 1 acre of green chilly, 3 acres for musk melon, 5 acres for banana, and 2 for pumpkin. Speaking of the mangoes grown in the farm, Mr. Sudharshan says, “We grow 95% banganapalli variety and the rest ottu, alphonsa and neelam varieties. Some of the local fruit stalls prefer our fruits for their home consumption during the season.” The total number of mango trees in the farm is 450. An average yield per tree is expected to be around 100 to 125 kg during mango season. Yogakshema farm is expecting around 6 tons of mangoes yield this season. A decent cropping is also expected from vegetables. Poor rainfall and electricity problems are expected to disrupt the yield this year. Though the farm is not organic, more FYM bio fertilizer, humic acid and panchakavya are used on the crops. The 3 acres where Mr. Sudharshan personally cultivates are exclusively used for preparation of panchakavya for personal and commercial use. “I want to support the local farmers by offering it to them at a cheap price, and encouraging them to reap its benefits,” says Mr. Sudharshan. The farm has equipments such as power sprayer, mist blower, and power weeder with 6 attachments used for farming activities. It has one small tractor and one high end tractor, cultivator, disc plough, rotavator and ridger. All produce of the firm are sold at local mandis. However, mandis make it difficult for the farm to sell the produce at the right price. “We were approached by a group who source from farmers and distribute to consumers directly at their door step. We are likely to tie up with them,” Mr. Sudharshan adds.Yogakshema Orchards and Farms wishes to successfully sustain in agriculture for as long as possible. Mr. Sudharshan holds 29 years of experience in financial advisory services. Sheer interest in farming since his childhood prompted him to resort to agriculture.
