Go to the shop Ecocert India – certification for Indian processed food products Home Ecocert India – certification for Indian processed food products Authorized to grant EU certification for Indian processed food products to be sold in European market Mukesh A.A Ecocert India was established in 2004 as inspection and certification body for organic, fair trade and good agricultural practices (GAP). It is located at Aurangabad in Maharashtra. Mr. Mukesh A.A, Operations Manager highlights recent major developments in organic certification standards. Earlier category of processed agricultural products for use as food was under the equivalence regime between NPOP (Indian regulations) and EC 834/2007 & 889/2008 (European regulation). Owing to equivalence all plant products and processed agricultural products for use as food that have been grown in India had easy access to European countries with usual NPOP certification. However, effective from 1st April 2013, the import regulations are amended by deleting the reference to processed products for use as food from India. “This makes the separate EU certification necessary for the processed agricultural products for use as food. Ecocert’s international office in France, Ecocert SA is authorized to grant this certification for Indian processed food products”, he further adds. A new trend has been observed in last 3-4 years where individual farmers are indeed coming forward for taking organic certification. These farmers also include the urban/hobby farmers who are into farming by choice. Among farmers, young generation farmers are more interested in getting into organic cultivation and selling certified goods. However they don’t sustain in the business for the want of dedicated marketplace. Organic certification expensive for farmers. To this Mr. Mukesh opines, “it is not the cost of certification which matters much. If the farmers get access to right and premium market, a certain upsurge can be seen in the number of farmers coming forward for certification”. He further adds, “as certification body are third party in nature and we ourselves do not really recommend to anyone. Organic certification is a need based phenomenon. More the demand is there in market for product endorsement, more will there be the demand for third party verification and certification.” It is the lack of assured and dedicated market for organic which is more discouraging for farmers than the cost of organic farming or certification. Company’s experience and statistics of past years is evident that demand for organic certified product is growing in market. Certification has to be renewed every year. It further demonstrates that almost all exporters (processors, traders of food, cosmetics and textiles etc.) renew their certification, proving the fact that third party organic certification does help them in getting higher sales and better earnings in export market. The proportion of regular renewal with regard to small individual farmers is much less owing to the fact that most of them try to sell in domestic market which is less organized and less matured.  Ecocert India is working with government of Sikkim currently for offering organic certification service. The costs are being borne by Sikkim Organic Mission. In coming years, in addition to offering usual organic certification service Ecocert India plans to offer training service to interested entrepreneurs and farmers. The training will be offered for more elaborate knowledge on organic regulations, specific requirements, certification procedures and tracenet requirements.
