Advocates for forage grass as cattle feed Kunal Soni Greenfield Agro Forestry Products started as a government seed supplier in 2 states in 2011 at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. The company now supplies its products to 15 countries. In India, it supplies to private business in 27 states and forest department in 6 States. The company’s proper-tier has been nominated for 5 National awards. Its seeds have covered more than 60 lakhs acres of land with greenery, nationally and internationally. Within three years the company has established its presence in nursery seeds sector worldwide. The company started dealing with forage grass, its major offering, 5 years ago. It initially supplied Stylo hamata grass for domestic cattle and dinath grass pennisetum pedicellatum for wild animals. It has now grown to more worldwide famous varieties like alfalfa medicago sativa and red sudan sorghum. Forage grasses are a more natural way of providing food to animals than the usual animal fodder. Farmers tend to provide hay, corn or mixture or sometimes byproducts of their crop. When one grows stylo hamata or alfalfa for rotational grazing, it allows cattle to move around and eat, enhancing their health through exercise, the natural way. Stored forage like hay tend to lose their nutritional value while it can be found highest in fresh green grass. Tall grass like sudan provides good nutrition. Scientists and doctors mention cattle should consume at least 35-40% of grasses like alfalfa or stylo hamata in its daily diet. A farmer that grows grass can use it for agro forestry practice, thus increasing the annual yield profitability. Grass like stylo hamata can be planted with citrus fruit trees while alfalfa can be planted with timber species and more. “Furthermore, grasses have nitrogen fixing properties which make a farm soil rich. Stylo hamata is a rough grass and can be grown on any terrain except clay soil. This gives farmer with barren soil a chance to feed their cattle and make their farm more productive” shares Mr. Soni, the Director of Greenfield. In India, the region around Gujarat is good for alfalfa, and for stylo hamata. Among South Indian states, Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh favour its growth. Since sudan needs more water, places closer to river or ones having high availability of water is suggested. Dinath can grow in any area, but shows best results amongst trees and forest regions. The company sells 50-60 tons of forage grass a year. It is expecting a rise in this figure, with the start of grass seed exports soon. Though it does not sell grass, Mr. Soni suggests sale of grass is a profitable business. Among its other businesses, Greenfield has a significant presence in the medicinal plants industry. Shatavari, kalmegh and ashwagandha are some medicinal plants that are currently great demand. The company exports plants to Turkey, European region and a few eastern countries. In forestry division, it works with timber, forest medicinal and many endangered species seeds. It also helps companies with high pollution credits to neutralize pollution by developing forests. Supplying endangered species seeds ensures the survival of these species. Nurseries, dairies, infra companies and high pollution factories are the major customers of the company. Having its presence all over the nation, the internet has been a major source of marketing. “Forestry is coming up as a great option in future for business. As long as it is used alone it is feasible for investors and land owners with vacant land and a different main stream business or job”, Mr. Soni signs off.
