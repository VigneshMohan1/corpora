Because of my dad health issues and labour problem, we want to move from traditional crops to plantation as long term investment. Primarly I was looking for any wood yielding plants like Eucalyptus, Teak and Malia Dupia, however I have to rule out Eucalptus for low income/ground water probelm; Teak for its longetivity and Malia Dupia because it doesn't grow well in black soil. Please suggest me any fruit yeilding or wood yielding plants where I can harvest them from 5 years. Looking for your suggestions and thoughts. Thanks Aditya Reply With Quote « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Posting Permissions You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts   BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On [VIDEO] code is On HTML code is Off Trackbacks are Off Pingbacks are Off Refbacks are On Forum Rules Contact Us AgricultureInformation.com Archive Top All times are GMT +5.5.
