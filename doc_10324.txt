Go to the shop Crown Solar Power Fencing System Home Crown Solar Power Fencing System Introduces GSM based controller for solar fencing to monitor farms 2001 was the year of establishment of Crown Solar Power Fencing System. Mr. Krishna Reddy laid the foundation stone of the company in Hyderabad to provide solar fencing solutions to farmers. Satisfied customers always motivated company officials to upgrade their system continuously. “We do so to meet the change in demand and requirements especially in agriculture field,” shares Mr. K Chandra Sekhar, Chief Executive. He informs that recently the company has introduced energizer with keypad and LCD accessible only by authorized persons. The main advantage is to avoid unauthorized access by any unknown persons. He adds, “Based on the request from some NRIs who have huge agricultural lands in India, we have introduced GSM-based controller which sends SMS to the customer about information such as time when it is switched on/off, any violation etc. It helps the customer to monitor and control on his system and its operations in India.” All systems offered by the company are tailor-made to meet customer requirements, have CE marking, and comply with Indian and international safety standards. Solar fence system can range from a few meters to a few kilometers. Solar fence system designed by Crown Solar operates well during winter and rainy season too. It has autonomy of 3 days (minimum) that takes care of cloudy or rainy days. If cloudy / rainy days are more than 3, then the design gets changed accordingly. Every system is having facility to connect to conventional supply (230 V AC 50 Hz) that is used to charge the battery to compensate rainy / cloudy days. “The response from customers is quite encouraging that guides us to introduce technology at affordable prices,” shares Mr. Sekhar. He disagrees to the statement that installation cost of solar solutions is high. He explains, “We take the help of available manpower with customers for installation. It reduces the cost, and people involved will be trained that helps them in maintaining the system independently later. The customer pays to & fro conveyance charges from our local office to the site and is happy to provide boarding & lodging to my engineers.” Maintenance cost depends on the perimeter length of system. For smaller length i.e. less than 1000 meters the maintenance cost shall be less than Rs.10,000 /annum. These days the company is suggesting HDPE sheets between posts to control vegetation which was a huge drawback in solar fence applications. “Major failures in solar fence system include vegetation and its maintenance. Earlier customers used to clean vegetation at regular intervals, and it was adding to the maintenance cost. HDPE sheets do not allow vegetation to touch fence strands (lines), and hence the maintenance has come down to almost nil,” informs Mr. Sekhar. Export is on the cards for the company. “As we now have CE marking, we are planning for exports to Asian, African, and European countries. We have proved to the world that Indians can design and manufacture better systems and in turn export the same to other countries at fewer prices – Make in India concept as promoted by our Hon’ble PM,” concludes Mr. Sekhar.
