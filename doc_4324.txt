Source: IANS The Confederation of Indian Industry states that the insurance sector of the country has been witnessing a consistent growth rate of late and its present worth is 41 billion US dollars. The industry has of late achieved a yearly growth rate within 32 and 34 percent and this makes it the 5 th best among emerging economies around the world. The various entities of the industry are also bringing out newer products on a regular basis to attract their customers. As per rules, the upper limit of foreign direct investment permitted in this sector is 26 percent. However, this has to be done through the automatic route and the investor needs a license from Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). At present there are 22 life insurers in India. The IRDA has recently taken away the tariffs of the interest rates and this has provided insurers greater independence when it comes to deciding the price of their insurance policies. The insurance industry has also become more competitive as a result. Yet another important factor affecting this sector has been the recent financial meltdown. India insurance industry growth in last few years The life insurance companies have performed the best when it comes to growth with an increase of almost 70% in new premium that has been collected in the initial 5 months of 2012. As per IRDA data, in April-August 2010 the insurance companies earned $11.73 billion in new premium - in the corresponding period in the previous year the amount stood at 6.9 billion dollars. LIC, a state held insurer, had been the biggest profit maker at that time with an addition of 88% to their existing business. The privately owned insurers together had seen a leap of 34% to their policy sales. ICICI Prudential earned 576.60 million dollars at that time. During April-August 2009 SBI Life had earned $379.20 million in sales of new policies and that figure went up to $531.87 million in the corresponding period in 2010 making it an increase of 40%. HDFC Standard Life also experienced a good growth of 54% in new sales. IRDA data shows that between April and October 2010 the general insurance industry experienced a year-on-year growth of 22.76% with regards to underwritten gross premium. The total value of that premium was 5.29 billion dollars while the same figure stood at $4.31 billion in April-October 2009. For the public sector companies the year-on-year growth rate was 21.09 percent between April-October 2010 and April-October 2009. In the same period the privately held insurers saw an increase of 25.19 percent in terms of premium collected. Among the publicly owned entities, New India Insurance was one of the better performers with a premium income of 916.77 million dollars in April-October 2010. At the same period in 2009 they had earned 770.25 million dollars which implies a growth rate of 19.04%. The IRDA Summary Report of Motor Data of Public and Private Sector Insurers 2009-10 states that in the same period almost 28.4 million policies were sold and the aggregate worth of premium collected was $2.31 billion. The health insurance sector, according to the RNCOS' research report named "Booming Health Insurance in India" posted unprecedented growth rates in 2008-09 and 2009-10. The report also estimates that between the 2009-10 and 2013-14 the sector would see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 25%.

They have questioned the logicality of opinions that in India the contribution can be higher saying that there are other important sectors like education, defense, and health that cannot be undermined in this context. They have ruled out possibilities that the sector can contribute 10% to India's GDP. The Chairman of IRDA, Hari Narayan has ruled out any such possibility asking if India's GDP growth will be that much in the next few years ahead. The IRDA states that in India land and gold are more preferred as forms of investment. Narayan feels that if the insurance sector is to do well in terms of contribution to GDP then more people should be convinced about its capability to provide good ROI (return on investment). Why are more people taking insurance policies? One of the major reasons for an increasing number of people availing insurance policies in India is the growing level of awareness. People nowadays value their lives, their health, and their families even more than before given the tough economic circumstances and so want to make sure that everything is fine even if they are not there. Yet another reason for the growing popularity of insurance policies is the benefit of tax exemption that is provided to family oriented and individual plans. Majority of the private insurers also provide lucrative returns and are now being availed by a section of the Indian society with greater disposable earnings. There is an aspect of psychological comfort attached to the insurance policies as well - whenever an insurance is availed the policyholder can be more or less assured of a safe future for that particular part of his or her life.
