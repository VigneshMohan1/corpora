The topography of the agro climatic zones of both areas are different ranging from sub-tropical in command & subtropical to temperate in non-command areas. The command area is 30% irrigated & where as only 10% of the area in non command is irrigated. In respect of crop production potential the command area is quite productive than upper areas. The district is situated at 320 17' to 320 55' North latitude and 750 70' to 760 16' East longitude. The district is surrounded by Punjab in the south-east, Himachal Pradesh in north-east, district Doda and Udhampur in North and north-west , Jammu in the west and Pakistan in the south-west.

Opportunities Department is targeting the increase in production and productivity of crops together with conservation of soil on sustained basis to meet the emerging needs of ever increasing population. Vast opportunities prevail for profitable diversification of existing cropping pattern within crops and towards non - crop husbandry Bridging yield gaps between average yield and attainable yield Threats Regular occurrence of Natural calamities. Weather congenial for high occurrence of pest and diseases Soil fertility loss due to erosion and leaching.
