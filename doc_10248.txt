Go to the shop Aditi Organic Certifications Home Aditi Organic Certifications Provides organic certification for horticulture, processed products, animal husbandry and beekeeping Narayana Upadhyaya “Organic certification is the in-thing nowadays,” says Mr. Narayana Upadhyaya, Director of Aditi Organic Certifications, based in Bengaluru. Company certifies horticulture crops, processed products, animal husbandry and beekeeping as per the norms of National Program for Organic Production (NPOP), Govt. of India and National Organic Program (NOP) of United States Department of Agriculture standards. “Many organic standards and logos make the consumer confused and so our certification norms are going to be revised soon depending on the international standards requirements,” informs Mr. Upadhyaya. There is a need to harmonize the different standards. It is extremely important that all stakeholders take responsibility to protect the integrity and sanctity of the certified organic products. Every country asks for organic certificate for the authenticity of the products. “Due to international demand, it is mainly traders/exporters that came forward to certification than farmers,” informs Mr. Upadhyaya. It is true that the farmers believe that the certification is expensive, which is not so, unless farmers sell their certified products. The transition period from conventional farming to organic needs farmer to have patience and lots of commitment to farming. Quality always pays. In organic farming and certification many aspects are taken into consideration including, soil, water, seeds, biodiversity, productivity, animal husbandry etc. However, with due State Government initiative and financial support from organizations like National Horticultural Mission, many farmers in group ventured into organic farming in the recent past. Many NGOs are also involved in the organic business as service providers. Farmers must be able to bring the story of their farming practices to the consumers in the form of certification, and they deserve to get better price for their products by looking into the care they have taken to supply healthy, nutritious, and contamination-free products. Mr. Upadhyaya shares the statistics of past three years: “Aditi’s clients marketed certified products worth Rs. 350 crore in domestic/international markets. The value additional due to certification varies from 10% to 50% depending on the communities. In extreme cases, value additional may even go higher (rare products). Even if you take 10% premium it was 35 crores”. The only shortcoming in the organic standards as of now is that it does not check how fairly the profit has been distributed / shared among the stakeholders/value chain including the farmers. In case a farmer fails to follow the organic practices after taking the certification then he loses the certification status and is bound to inform immediately about the usage of such chemicals. Farmer must not sell such contaminated products as organic. He adds, “This clause we have mentioned in our certification contract, which we conclude with the farmer or a client before we give certification services.” To avoid all situations of using chemical farming inputs, the farmer must have enough organic resources or control measures to take care of pests or diseases problem. Giving services to those involved in nature-friendly activities and starting R & D projects in and around Bengaluru related to organic agriculture are the future plans of Mr. Upadhyaya. He holds masters in horticulture and has specialized in tissue culture. He is involved in organic inspection and certification since two decades now.
