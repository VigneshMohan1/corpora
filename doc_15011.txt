During the last 50 years, it has travelled a long distance and today NSC along with 16 other seed producing companies in the Government sector produce about 60% of the total certified/ quality seeds in the country. The balance 40% is being produced by various private seed companies including several MNCs. The growth of NSC during the last five years has been quite impressive. Detailed financial position is available under separate head "Financial Performance" in the website. The turnover and net profit during the Year 2012-13 was ` 691.34 crores and ` 44.30 crores respectively.   The seed scenario in the country is changing fast and with significant increase in Seed Replacement Ratio (SRR) of major field crops during the last one decade and availability of plenty of certified/quality seeds in the country, the competition is hotting up with entry of several multi-national companies in the production of quality seeds and farmers’ preferences are changing from varieties to hybrids. Therefore, all the seed producing companies including NSC have to give more stress in improving its product basket both in terms of better varieties/hybrids as well as improved services to the farming community. The success of NSC in future in maintaining its key position as a dependable supplier of quality seeds at affordable prices will largely depend on its technical as well as marketing personnel who have to work very hard with full commitment and dedication and ensure that NSC produces high quality seeds and the farmers who buy such seeds derive the maximum level of satisfaction in terms of value for their money. Working since 1963, under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture of Government of India.
