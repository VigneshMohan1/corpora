Go to the shop Sprouting Large Scale Mushrooms – Mr. Sushant Shekhar Home Sprouting Large Scale Mushrooms – Mr. Sushant Shekhar Mushroom producer and supplier at Bangalore since 2009. Also provides consultancy Sushant Shekhar Dedicated to the memory of his late sister Jaya, Mr. Sushant Shekhar set up Jayaa Agro Foods in 2009 in Bangalore. The company specializes in mushroom cultivation. Beginning with a 10 Kg production unit, the company has grown remarkably and is now building a new manufacturing facility with a production capacity of 1.5 ton of mushroom per day in Deoghar, Jharkhand. Mushrooming Consultancy The company ventured into mushroom consultancy in 2011. “Over the last 1.5 years of this consultancy, we have completed around 23 projects spread across the country,” maintains Mr. Shekhar, adding, “We have been helping all our clients based on our own experience in this business. One of the major aspects of starting a business is the cost factor. We have been guiding our clients to a low investment and highly compact cultivation process. We help in the complete process of production.” He points out that the wastage due to spoilage, contamination, rodents and other insect infestation is around 30 – 35% in mushroom cultivation. “I have been able to control the spoilage to around 5% with most of my clients, wherein some are cultivating mushroom with 0% contamination.” Mr. Shekhar received an award for supporting self-help groups. In February this year he received Karnataka Suvarna Shri Award for being a young entrepreneur and supporting people into the agri business. Pasteurization Technique Jayaa Agro has developed a pasteurization technique that minimizes the energy usage, maintains low moisture in substrate and controls contamination up to 99%. “Our pasteurization unit is 8 to 10 times cheaper than the machinery available in the market. The unit is under trial now and is showing good results. It is expected to be ready by next 3-4 months,” maintains Mr. Shekhar. Production Challenges The company supplies mushroom to local grocery, caterers and local dealers. The major challenges have been contamination and yield. “Due to irregular production, availability is affected, which in turn affects the potential market. Also, we need to address the pricing of mushroom in the market. Government needs to come up with some plan to bring down the cost of raw materials which would help in capping the price,” says Mr. Shekhar. Substrate to Compost The company utilizes the spent mushroom substrate for the preparation of compost. They supply this compost mainly to farmers involved in horticulture. “We have been handling our marketing channel by spreading awareness about the product and also utilizing online marketing resources. We also use social networking sites,” informs Mr. Shekhar. Promoting Rain Water Harvesting Jayaa Agro promotes rain water harvesting. “Water availability became a challenge for us and we had to resort to purchasing water from other sources, increasing the production cost. To avoid this we built a large underground water storage unit. Even if it would rain once a week or 10 days, we had sufficient water for all our work. It was only during non-raining period, we had to make other arrangements. The unit which we are building up presently in Jharkhand will be completely implementing rainwater harvesting,” he says. Future Perfect Mr. Shekahar wants to enable the rural population towards a better economic growth. “I want to become the channel to connect technology to the people so that it can be largely harnessed. I am currently working on a proposal in this regard and expect to present it to the government of Bihar and Jharkhand,” he maintains. Mr. Shekhar has completed his master’s degree in biotechnology and is currently doing his Ph.D in microbiology.
