Poor farmers or marginal farmers fall prey to the trap of high yield, instant market and quick returns. Even tough, it is at the cost of their health.

Organic cultivation is latest trend in agriculture. but the major question is on its economic viability. Organic cultivation is possible because the trend can be latest but the practice is very old. if we forget the last 40-50 years, the agriculture was totally organic. The chemical application started with the population growth. which is growing day by day. Now the question is that , Are we able to supply the food to this population ??? or we can say that are the organic practices able to increase the productivity with quality. It is clear in that in current situation farmers can't get profit from organic agriculture. In addition there is additional cost of certification in organic agriculture. The return is not too much profit making. Or i can say that, this not possible for the general public to eat the organic food due to its higher cost of cultivation. generally it can be around 3 time or 4 time. The worst fact is that there is no assurity that organic certified product is chemical free. I will discuss rest of the fact here in later comments.

The demand for organic produce would be higher in future.

The normal farmer earns more in comparison to the farmer who is practicing the organic. Some big players in organic industry don't by pass the profit to the farmers. the organic product byer is more concerned about the packing, packing material, branding. already the cultivation cost is too much for the farmer, these processing cost make it more vulnerable for the normal customer. The ultimate profit goes to the seller not to the producer. The certification system make it more costlier for the small farmer.

The farmers suffer a heavy loss in organic cultivation due to the insect pest attack Reply With Quote October 21st, 2013 #19 guargum Join Date Mar 2013 Posts 418 Blog Entries 12 There is no assured marketing or supply chain rout for organic agriculture. There is problem of the organic identification. if some seller is standing in the market he cant differentiate his product from the normal produce. or I can say the buyer can not differentiate the inorganic and organic.
