Eric's Archived Thoughts: White Blotches meyerweb .com Exploration Powered by Google Skip to: site navigation/presentation Skip to: Thoughts From Eric White Blotches Fri 21 Mar 2014 1401 Cancer Rebecca 93 responses Yesterday, the news came that Fred Phelps had died.  A lot of things have been said about him, some reflective, many unkind.  I always thought that whether or not he actually believed it, he promulgated a particularly consistent (and therefore, it might be argued, honest) strain of theology. Because if you truly believe that everything is in God’s hands, that everything happens due to God’s will, and that God should be praised for His works, then yes, if you thank God for good fortune and miraculous happenings, then you should also thank God for MH370, for 9/11, for dead soldiers, for abortions, for tragedies, for anything and everything that happens. You should thank Him for the tumors in a little girl’s brain. Yesterday, we got the news that a new tumor has emerged, far from the site of the first tumor, outside the proton radiation zone.  It’s growing incredibly fast.  The MRI eight weeks ago showed nothing unusual there, and now there’s a white blotch almost the size of her left eyeball. From what we can see on the MRI, this tumor is intermingled with brain tissue.  To remove it is to cut out a piece of her brain. It may still be removable, despite the damage that will inflict.  We are waiting to hear from CHOP whether they feel surgery is an option.  If so, then we will go back to Philadelphia, whenever they tell us to be there.  This time, the whole family will go together.  After the surgery, if it happens, there will probably be another two months of radiation and chemotherapy. If surgery is not an option, then Rebecca most likely has no more than a few weeks to live.  The tumor is growing too fast to expect anything else.  She will never be six, or graduate kindergarten. I want to tell you that I have hope and confidence in a good outcome, but I can’t.  Because, for the first time, I don’t.  I expect that the pain and grief I feel now will soon seem like the smallest of aches. We haven’t given up on her or her treatment.  We will still do everything we can for her.  Including, when the time comes, making the best decisions we can about the length and quality of her life, when one must be sacrificed for the other.  Those choices will be in our hands, and I hope we’ll have the strength to choose wisely. No matter what, we’ll be there for Rebecca, all of us.  Kat and me, Carolyn and Joshua, our family and friends.  For her, and for each other. 93 Responses » Trackback URL Comments RSS feed # 1 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1409 David Mead wrote in to say... I am so sorry to hear that Eric. Rebecca, and your whole family, are in my thoughts. # 2 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1409 Rebecca Blood wrote in to say... Well, my heart just broke. I don’t know if I believe in God or not, but it takes someone with a good deal more faith or philosophy than me to thank God for the tumors in Rebecca’s brain. I guess I would thank God for the opportunity you have to parent her. For the opportunity your whole family has to love her and be her family. For the wonderful miracle for her to have all of you as her family. You as her parents. How lucky she is for that. I don’t know if I believe in God, but I want you to know that I’m praying for all of you with all my heart. And thanking him/her for the wonderful blessing she and you have to be a family together. Love love love to all of you. # 3 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1410 Doug Pascover wrote in to say... Just terrible. My thoughts are with you all. Especially Rebecca.

Such horrible, horrible news. News that no one who has been following what you have shared of your lives since last summer wants to hear. My heart, and thoughts and prayers go out to you and your family, Eric. I hope you find strength in the community of family and friends who have drawn around you, near and far. # 11 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1426 Doug LeMesurier wrote in to say...

I’m so sorry to hear of this latest development. Sending you all my thoughts and hopes for a positive outcome. # 19 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1517 Albin Johnson wrote in to say... I am so sorry to hear of yet another small child suffering. My daughter Katie was diagnosed with a diffuse pontene glioma in 2004 and after eight months of fighting it she died in my arms at the age of seven. It sucks. And you have every right to be mad as hell at God. I was. It’s too soon and too close to ponder views on God – it’s too fresh. But I thank God every day for Katie and yes, I thank Him for giving me the entire plan. It’s better than no plan at all, or no Katie at all. Picking the worst of life to demonstrate God’s plan won’t give you the entire vision. It takes time and perspective. But don’t do that now – right now, just be mad as hell at God. He’s big enough to take your criticism. Deal with this. Be there for your family. If you want to lean on God, do it – if you’d rather He left the room for a while that’s perfectly understandable. Believe me, when I die I will have plenty of questions (like letting kids die) for Him and I won’t hold back. Important thing is, you deal with it how you need to – it’s different for everyone. Just know a lot of people love you and are thinking about you. I’ve been there, it’s the worst thing in the world. Bless you – you’ll be near to my heart over this. # 20 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1526 Michael Hatch wrote in to say... So sorry to hear this, praying for the best possible outcome. Thank you for being so brave about sharing something so personal. # 21 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1526 Ethan wrote in to say...

Having two kids of my own, I cannot even begin to imagine how difficult this all must be. I have nothing else I can say other than you have my deepest sympathy and I pray for a that the outcome somehow defies the odds. # 23 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1626 Lila Hanft wrote in to say... Oh.

I’m sad to hear of this news. Please keep hope alive as long as possible. Let the doctors do the medical thing. If you haven’t been offered palliative care, now is the time to ask. They know best how to provide the best quality of life possible for your little girl and your family while you ride this to its conclusion; positive or negative. Om tare tuttare ture svaha My all obstacles to Rebecca’s healing be removed. Best wishes to you and yours, always. pixelsrzen. _/|\_ # 27 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1649 Chris wrote in to say... So very sorry to hear this news. Thank you for sharing, and so eloquently. I am full of admiration, as well as empathy. It seems to me that you’re amazing parents. I know you say you have no choice and just have to do what you do to try and do your best for Rebecca, but the way you have handled yourselves and handled your thoughts and feelings ever since the first news broke in the summer has been superhuman, as well as utterly and wonderfully human. You are a model for every parent with a sick kid. Thank you. You are very much in our thoughts. Wishing Rebecca, and every one of you, all the very best, and hoping you’ll get the best possible news from now on. # 28 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 1653 Faruk Ateş wrote in to say...

Every time I think of Rebecca and her circumstance, the words dribble out of my head. I splutter. As I said to Simon St. Laurent immediately after he told me: “…And I think I’ve got problems.” (And I do. But not like this.) I’ll be over here spluttering. Let me know if there’s a single damned thing I can do to help. # 43 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2014 Brian Hart wrote in to say... So sorry to hear this news Eric. Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. # 44 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2018 Genevieve Southern wrote in to say... Eric, I know we’ve only met a handful of times, but I have read your blog for years and have been following this journey of yours with Rebecca and wanted to tell you how sorry I am to hear about the new tumors and prognosis. I wish I could think of the right things to say that would be poetic and eloquent and express the empathy I feel and the need I feel right now to go hug my own children, one of whom is the same age as your daughter. However, all I can say is that I am thinking of your family and that reading this brought a pain in the pit of my stomach and tears to my eyes and I can only imagine what you are feeling. # 45 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2019 Kris wrote in to say... It’s so hard to read this news, and my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. And if there is a God, I’m quite sure that he’s not responsible for any plan that mandates a short life for Rebecca. Yet if there is a God who is behind Rebecca existing, we can still be thankful that she has lived at all, for any amount of time. And that she is now in your family and surrounded by your love. As I witness the many lives — and many types of lives — present in this world, I’m less convinced that life (and anything that matters, really) is best measured by time. Quality and quantity are rarely directly in proportion. A 3 minute song can be much more beautiful and impactful than a 3 hour saga. The real miracle, whether via God or not, is that we breathe, laugh, and live at all. For any amount of time. Nonetheless, I hope Rebecca’s life is both beautiful and long. Peace. # 46 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2040 Krista wrote in to say... You and your family are in my thoughts. Beaming strength and hope to you and yours, Eric. # 47 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2045 Melissa Pantel-Ku wrote in to say... We are holding your entire family in our thoughts and in our hearts. Melissa, Ray, Ronen, Nya # 48 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2114 Hick Crone wrote in to say... Childhood cancer and justice are opposites. A magical justice would allow me to give some portion of my remaining time to Rebecca. My opening offer would be five years. Oh, how I wish I could… # 49 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2125 Grant Hutchinson wrote in to say... Oh. My. If there was anything I could say or do at this point, you know I would. Thinking deeply and sincerely of you and your family is the best I can offer. Strength, love, and hope, my friend. Strength, love, and hope. # 50 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2216 Petra Gregorová wrote in to say... I can’t even find the words to express my emotions after reading all this. All I can say that Rebecca and all your family is in my thoughts and hope for the best. Wish there was something I could do. # 51 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2218 @JeffreyPia wrote in to say... No words months ago, and no words yet today. Not sure if it makes a difference, but sending positive vibes your way. # 52 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2305 Agency Fusion wrote in to say... Cannot imagine what you are going through. I will keep you and your family in my prayers. # 53 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2308 John wrote in to say... We all live on borrowed time. A seemingly perfectly healthy could pass away tomorrow, sooner than a sick patient, who knows. My point is illness and life is beyond us, so while you’re fighting the disease, please do remember to enjoy life while you can. This is only thing we have control of. I wish there is God and he hears your struggle and will deliver you and your family out of trouble. blessings! # 54 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2328 Bob McDonald wrote in to say... There really aren’t any words, but I feel compelled to say something. Our thoughts are with you. Wishing you, the doctors, other caregivers, everyone surrounding that precious little girl, the utmost in wisdom, strength, and grace. # 55 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2333 Steve Fisher wrote in to say...

Best of worlds to you and yours, Eric. Best of possible worlds. Much love your way. # 57 Comment Fri 21 Mar 2014 2351 Tetra wrote in to say... Just lost my mother-in-law to inoperable brain cancer last Sunday. I’ve been following your saga with Rebecca for a few months via Ferrett’s and Gini’s journals (I’m Lunabird over there). I don’t think I’ve commented before, but my heart goes out to you guys. I can’t imagine how tough this would be go through with a daughter. Brain cancer is the worst. The absolute worst. I am so sorry you guys are going through this. # 58 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 0042 Bob Monsour wrote in to say... Without looking back at your prior posts, the image of Rebecca’s amazingly cute and smiling image is etched in my mind I am so very sad to hear of this current development. My prayers continue to be with her, you and your entire family. I cannot imagine your pain at this moment. I am, however, confident that you and Kat will do your utmost to make the best decisions for Rebecaa, whatever they may be. # 59 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 0142 Tsubomi wrote in to say...

You and Kat are experiencing life as deeply as it can get.

Your family is in my thoughts and prayers, and I am desperately hoping for a positive outcome for Becca and for all of you. # 62 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 0719 Barbara Gavin wrote in to say... This is what I am hoping for, or praying for, and just plain want. That you all have the strength and knowledge to choose wisely. Umm, that and a damn miracle. Including, when the time comes, making the best decisions we can about the length and quality of her life, when one must be sacrificed for the other. Those choices will be in our hands, and I hope we’ll have the strength to choose wisely. # 63 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 0945 Bridget Stewart wrote in to say... I don’t have words, only tears. I want things to go so much better for you and for your family. I wish I could do more than pray. # 64 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 1228 Deborah Edwards-Onoro wrote in to say...

Clutching my 5yo tighter today. # 66 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 1830 OJ wrote in to say... I am so, so sorry to hear this. I am a total non-believer, so I won’t say that I’ll pray for you. I will however say that I really hope that the doctors are able to find a solution which will give Rebecca the biggest opportunity for a full life and to maximise the time that you guys have together, however long that is. I can not pretend to know how you must be feeling, that would be patronising and derogatory to your experience. I can empathise though. The thought of having this kind of news would destroy me, as I think it would any parent. All the best, and good luck. OJ # 67 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 2025 Estelle Weyl wrote in to say... I am so sorry. This is not the news you were supposed to get. This is not the news we wanted to hear. We were all rooting. We were all hoping. We were all wishing. We are still all rooting, hoping and wishing for the best for Rebecca, you, Kat, the whole family, and your caregivers. We all wish there was something we could do to help. Please don’t hesitate to ask. # 68 Comment Sat 22 Mar 2014 2026 Paul Matchen wrote in to say... I’m so deeply sorry to read this. No words can do justice. Be there for her.

Prayers for physical, emotional, and spiritual strength as you endure this extremely difficult trial. # 75 Comment Sun 23 Mar 2014 2137 Carolyn Wood wrote in to say... I am so deeply sorry to hear this. I wish the doctors and you and Kat wisdom. I wish you the ability to be merciful to yourself when you aren’t sure what to say or do or choose. I wish that you all become even closer through this. I hope for a glimmer of hope. I wish that, somehow, you feel a kind of love from everyone, from all of life itself, to carry you through, no matter how rough the ride. I wish for brilliant surprises. # 76 Comment Sun 23 Mar 2014 2206 Deborah wrote in to say... You saved Rebecca’s life the day you brought her into your home.

My thoughts are with you all. # 80 Comment Mon 24 Mar 2014 1206 Andrea wrote in to say... Eric, It breaks my heart to hear this news, I am a parent like you and I work for a children’s hospital. No child should know disease like this, no parent should hear news like you have heard, I see this at the hospital all too often and it angers me, it saddens me, and it scares me like nothing else can. I also ask why? It’s like life is a russian roulette, anyone can get it, you don’t deserve this, no one does, no one. You and your family are in my thoughts, even if we don’t know each other I share in your pain. As parents we don’t get the luxury of breaking down forever as we want to in moments like this, I send you strength and courage in this difficult time, and all I can tell you is surround your daughter with love because at the end of it all, the best thing we can have in our entire lives is to be loved. # 81 Comment Mon 24 Mar 2014 1435 Nancy Seeger wrote in to say... So heartbreaking to read the latest, hoping for better news soon for Rebecca, you and your family!

Here’s hoping for good news # 83 Comment Mon 24 Mar 2014 1845 Michael wrote in to say... I wish I could trade my improbable recovery from a very serious brain tumor to your daughter.
