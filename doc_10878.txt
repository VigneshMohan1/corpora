Broad vision and positive approach behind successful operations today Munish Kumar Punjab Dairy Farm was established in October 2010 by Mr. Munish Kumar and Mr. Sanjeev Kumar. The farm is primarily involved in milk selling and breeding of cows. The annual turnover of the company is Rs. 5 crores. In times, when money matters more than passion, the duo chose the latter and started the farm with 200 milking cows and 400 calves. The initial investment on the farm was made more with the betterment of the farm in mind, than quick returns. One such step in this direction was mechanization of milking process. A huge risk was taken by the founders, as they incepted the mechanization process right in the beginning. About Rs. 75 lakhs was invested. “It was too difficult initially to retain the things with deep pockets. Anyhow it was very clear in the beginning that we need to have the long term investments in this venture. The vision helped us to attain this success story which is still going on” shares Mr. Munish. The process includes milking parlor, bulk milk chiller, sprinklers, solar water system, computerized back-end support and DG set for power back-up. Speedy procedure, less manpower, hygiene due to zero human touch, increase in shelf life, better taste, mastitis free, and MIS of each milking animal with its history are the benefits. The ROI on mechanization has been positive. “The animals are fully co-operative” Mr. Munish adds. He believes mechanization is more suitable for farms that have large number of animals. Lack of mechanization in dairy farms, he adds, is a big setback in the industry. Milk is first stored in the BMC and then chilled to 3 degree Celsius. All vans have insulated tanks to maintain the temperature till the milk is delivered to the customers at their door steps. The farm has 1 doctor and 3 pharmacists on pay rolls, to keep a check on the health of the cattle. Having given their best in the business, the farm has carved a good name with its customers. “We do not have to search for the prospective customers. They are always in queue” Mr. Manish says. People buy cow’s milk for intake and buffalo milk for products with fat. The farm has been advertising itself merely through word of mouth. An existing customer brings a new customer if satisfied with the quality of milk delivered to him. Door to door campaigns done initially brought in the first set of customers. The number of customers has been on the rise since then. The farm currently serves people in Punjab. They hope to cater their service to Chandigarh in the coming times. Adding perfection to passion helped the farm progress in a term as short as three years. Mr. Munish relies on his focus and dedication to work, and plans to continue the same commitment. He wishes to make the dairy a destination to set an example where people should visit with their kids to have a knowledge tour about dairy farming. Mr. Munish is a graduate and holds a diploma in dairy farming. He has 4 years of experience in the industry. In a world where earning a living is more important than following one’s own heart, he has treaded a path of his own with his belief that he signs off with: “Never ever give up. There is always a silver line in the dark clouds.” Our Correspondent For more details, contact : Punjab Dairy Farm, Bank Bazaar, Bathinda, Punjab Mob: 98884 20000 Email: ajay.kumar@tycoongroup.in Web: www.punjabdairy.in Source : Agriculture & Industry Survey Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Punjab Dairy Farm Related – articles, consultants, downloads Fourseasonz – dairy farm Satya Sai Dairy Farm Eva Dairy Farm Khurana Dairy Farm You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
