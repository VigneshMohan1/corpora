GIAHS - Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems: SITES Text only version العربية english français Español HOME GIAHS THE INITIATIVE SITES INFORMATION RESOURCES NEWS AND EVENTS PARTNERS CONTACT US   Africa Asia and the Pacific Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Near East and North Africa Home  > SITES Sites Agricultural Heritage Systems can be found all over the world. Characteristically, these systems are rich in agricultural biodiversity and associated wildlife, and are important resources of indigenous knowledge and culture. In the selected GIAHS sites a conservation programme based on adaptive management is in place. This programme is based on the search for economic viability of the system, the identification of environmentally sustainable strategies in the face of growing climate change, and the empowerment of small holder/traditional family farming and indigenous communities.  This map shows only a preliminary selection of GIAHS where dynamic conservation activities are on-going. Activities are supported by the Global Environmental Facility, Federal Government of Germany, International Fund for Agriculture Development and others. There are many other Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems around the world that need to be identified and recognized.
