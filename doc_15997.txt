DSS _11_10_2010_ IMMEDIATE No.31-1/2010-DM Government of India Ministry of Agriculture Department of Agriculture & Cooperation (Drought Management Division) ***** Krishi Bhavan, New Delhi Dated the 11th October, 2010 To The Chief Secretary All State Governments / UT Administrations. Subject: Diesel Subsidy scheme during Kharif 2010 in Drought and Deficit Rainfall Affected Areas. Sir / Madam, I am directed to say that in view of deficit rainfall in various parts of the country during South-West Monsoon, 2010 and its likely impact on Agriculture Operations during Kharif 2010 season, it has been decided to provide financial assistance to the State Governments/UT Administrations which have decided to introduce diesel subsidy for the farmers to enable the farmers to provide supplementary irrigation through diesel pumpsets in the drought and deficit rainfall affected areas to protect the standing crops. This will help in mitigating the adverse impact of drought/deficit rainfall conditions on foodgrain production. 2. The Scheme will be applicable in the following cases: (i) Districts where the rainfall deficit was more than 50% as on 14th July 2010, as reported by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); (ii) Talukas / districts which were declared as drought affected areas by the respective State Governments; and (iii) Areas with prolonged dry spell continuously for 15 days, i.e., scanty rainfall (deficit of 60% or more of normal) for any continuous 15 days period, starting from 14th July 2010 onwards, as per reports of IMD. 3. The mode of implementation will be as under: (i) The scheme on Diesel Subsidy will be implemented with the participation of the State Governments/UT Administrations, with a view to offset the cost of diesel used for pumping water for providing supplementary irrigation. (ii) The farmers in the affected regions shall be covered between 14th July, 2010 to 30th September, 2010. (iii) It is intended to provide 50% subsidy on the cost of diesel to the affected farmers for upto three protective irrigations subject to a maximum total subsidy of ` 1250 per hectare, limited to maximum of two hectares per farmer. Assistance so provided through subsidy shall be shared between the Government of India and the State Governments/UT Administrations concerned on 50:50 basis and subject to the participating States/UTs willing to contribute their share of subsidy. (iv) It shall be the responsibility of the State Governments / UT Administrations concerned to initially extend the full subsidy amount to the farmers in the drought and deficit rainfall affected areas. (v) In case the State Governments/UT Administrations concerned decide on a higher percentage of subsidy, the Government of India’s 50% contribution would be capped to a maximum of 50% cost of diesel, subject further to a cap at ` 10.00 per litre. In case the State Governments/UT Administrations concerned offer a lower subsidy, then GoI’s share will be limited to 50% of the said lower subsidy amount. In no case shall the Government of India’s contribution be more than ` 10.00 per litre and ` 625 per hectare. (vi) The scheme will operate on reimbursement basis. The State Governments/UT Administrations shall claim reimbursement as special grants-in-aid for getting the Central share of the subsidy so paid, after full disbursement of the subsidy amount to the farmers. 4. The modalities of disbursement of subsidy to the farmers shall be devised by the State Governments/UT Administrations concerned (including cases in which the State Governments/UT Administrations decide to introduce this scheme in their States/UTs) and the modality adopted by them would be intimated to the Ministry of Agriculture immediately. 5. A copy of the Proforma, in which the reimbursement shall be claimed, is enclosed. 6. The Scheme shall be implemented by the Principal Secretary / Secretary of the Department of Agriculture of the State Governments/UT Administrations concerned. 7.
