Go to the shop Safe & Save Equipments – eFence Solar Energy Home Safe & Save Equipments – eFence Solar Energy Founded in May 2005 in the Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu, eFence Solar Energy provides electric fences powered by solar energy to various customers such as innovative and private limited farms, NRIs and other executives in the farming industry. Mr. Senthil Kumar, a BBA graduate with an additional diploma in agriculture, runs the company with the help of his consultant, Dr. Baluchamy. Solar Power Fences : Establishing a solid position in the market, the company sells the solar power fence as a security measure at the competitive price of RS 160 per meter with 10 horizontal lines. The eFence works by emitting a painful but safe jolt of electricity to any who come in contact with the fence thus working as a psychological barrier. The fence can also detect any shorting or tampering. Marketing and Competition  : With corporate companies proving to be Mr. Senthil’s main competitors, he relies on the quality of the materials he uses as well as after sales services to make his products more appealing. Mr. Senthil also makes use of publicity and demonstrations to further market the eFence. To better serve its customers, the company also employed the use of surveys and questionnaires. Future Plans : With the power crisis in India, the company has undertaken the challenge to provide an alternate source of energy to clients, but its potential depends on the needs of customers.  However, eFence has shown its solid client base with over 200 customers. For now, the company simply plants an annual growth of 40%.
