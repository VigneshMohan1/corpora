Owner of a 15 acre land plot, he now plans to get into a Stevia cultivation partnership venture. After conducting intense research in the field of herbal/medicinal plants and studying its costing and profit margins, he chose Stevia for cultivation as there is a growing demand in the overseas market for Stevioside which comes from the Stevia plant.  Stevioside is effecting in remedying diabetes, obesity and tooth decay problems.  Mr. Joshi is also looking into various other useful medicinal/herbal plants for cultivation. Finances The Government alongwith NABARD is actively working towards providing easy finance for upcoming farmers at attractive interest rates. Talking about arranging capital for his farming venture, Mr. Joshi said, “We associated with a company, who provided us guidance and prepared a project to enable us to take an Agricultural loan. The Government provides lots of incentives to farmers so it is easy to take an Agriculture loan from any local NABARD associated bank.” Future Plans Mr. Joshi says, “I am planning to start various contract farming projects by associating with farming companies and farmers. Moreover, there is a huge demand of various fertilizer and farming equipments, so being an importer I would like to start retail outlets of fertilizer and farming equipments and www.agricultureinformation.com provides a good database of various contract farming companies.” For more information, contact : Vishal Joshi, “SHIV-SHAKTI” 1-RAM PARK NR.
