The word ‘Jharkhand' connotes ‘ area of land covered with forests' . Therefore, literally as well as symbolically, Jharkhand is associated with forests. Various ethnic groups such as Munda, Oraon, Ho, Santhal, Paharia, Chero, Birjea, Asura and other have influenced their ecosystems by varying practices of agro-pastoralism over the years. Traditionally, these indigenous people have symbiotic relations with forests. Local festivals like Sarhul and Karma are customarily related with worshipping of trees.  View more...
