Training: Increase in fodder production in the Region. Fodder Demonstrations: Increase in fodder production by the farmers. The performance of the Department and success indicators will be influenced and affected by the following factors: i) The proposed target can be increased subject to the construction of Rain water harvesting pond, Sprinkler Irrigation facility, Purchase of new Agricultural implements, Tractor, Providing electrical service connection & bore well to the farm etc. ii) Natural conditions: Fodder seed production is a seasonal activity and dependent on weather conditions (Rain fall etc) iii) Insect and diseases (natural calamities) may also affect the seed and fodder production. Section 5: Specific Performance Requirements from other Departments 1.ICAR and Department of Agriculture and Co-operation:-will be responsible for making available improved varieties and quality fodder seeds well in advance as the farm is fully dependent on it.
