Go to the shop Safe Agroinputs and Consultancy Home Safe Agroinputs and Consultancy Manufacturer and supplier of organic fertilizers, growth stimulators and pest repellents. Also extends consultancy services Sudheesh Nair Safe Agroinputs and Consultancy was established in 1997 by Mr. Sudheesh Nair at S.Vazhakkulam, Aluva in Kerala. Recently it shifted to Nedungapra Perumbavoor, Kerala. The company manufactures and supplies agricultural farming inputs like biotech and organic fertilizers, growth stimulators and pest repellents and also provides consultancy services. Main vegetation includes coffee, tea, cardamom, ginger, banana, vegetables like potato, carrot, bitter-gourd etc. Areas covered are Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Their achievement includes production of Ecofer, Calciphos Humix, Ecomulti-X, and Provita-G amongst many other products and also the development of TC (tissue culture) ginger seedlings called Himachal and Rigoddi. Safe Agroinputs’ main products offered to the farmers are Calciphos Humix, Ecofer, Provita-G and Saico bio-compost which are very much in demand in plantations and for horticulture. “The ginger planters are using these products very much to increase production and resistivity,” comments Mr Nair. He shares, “We have developed mixed cultivation method as the mix cultivation enables farmers to secure more profit. Even if the farmers are aware of the drawbacks of chemical cultivation and are interested in applying only organic cultivation, organic cultivation alone is not economical for small farmers.” A mix of organic products to resurrect the soil and chemical inputs for faster result is needed to get more profits. For example, to produce 1 MT of cardamom through organic methods the cost may be around Rs.7 lakhs but through chemical ways it could be reduced to Rs. 4 lakhs and through mixed cultivation it would cost around Rs.4-5 lakhs. Organic products provide the plants healthy growth and double the quantity but fast pest control and disease management are achieved only by chemical inputs as organic ways are slow. “Thus I am advising to use both to get more production,” adds Mr. Nair. He assures that their products can be mixed along with vermicompost and other organic manure to attain better results than the individual use of either product. The ratio for mixing would depend upon the soil condition, climate and crop type. Responding to quality query he says, “We are getting business only because we provide quality products along with good service.” Majority of the company’s products are supplied directly to farmers to avoid middleman and to provide discounts which would help the farmers in getting more profit. The products are not for any specific plants but applicable to all cultivation. The company also offers consultancy services to its clients for the proper and efficient application of the products. Free services over the phone and by means of limited field visits are provided to clients. Additional field visits are also provided for which they charge. Mr. Nair is receiving satisfactory response from his clientele. He shares, “My future plan is to develop new farming technologies, methods and products, without causing damage to the nature and farmers.” Mr Nair has a B.Sc in Botany and diploma in Agri-plant protection.
