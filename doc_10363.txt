Go to the shop Ganga Kaveri Seeds Home Ganga Kaveri Seeds Focused to develop and introduce high quality seeds for the Indian farmers Ganga Kaveri Seeds is one of the oldest seed companies in the country. It was started with the introduction of sudan sorghum grass for animal feed more than 40 years ago. It is also the biggest private sector seed company in the public variety paddy seed business. The turnover of the company is approximately Rs. 160 crores. Company is located at Hyderabad. The most recent products of the company are hybrid rice product marshal, two research paddy varieties, hybrid pearl millet variety and a cotton hybrid vijay. The hybrid and research paddy products are high yielding and versatile. It can be grown under different soil and climatic conditions. The pearl millet product can compete with the market leader in key markets. The hybrid cotton product vijay is known to perform excellently in diverse conditions of soil, water availability and farmer practices. In terms of hybridization, corn and cotton are close to 90% hybridized, sunflower is 100% hybrid while pearl millet is 50% hybridized. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra are the biggest markets of Ganga Kaveri Seeds for hybrid corn, hybrid research and paddy and sunflower, the key products of the company. Mr. Hanumantha Rao is of the opinion that irrespective of the seeds being Op or Hybrid, chemical fertilizers give better yield. Talking on replica seeds in the market he goes on to add that the term “duplicate seed” is a wrong conception. “The issue is, given that seed is a live organism, its performance may not be uniform across all geographies as soil, water, climate and even farmer practices differ from location to location. In fact, we can show you fields next to each other where one farmer gets 15 quintals of cotton while the other can barely get 8 quintals. Also given that climate even in the same location is not the same each year, performance would vary year on year, giving rise to the farmer’s complaint of non-performance,” he elucidates. Affording the company’s seeds has never been an issue with the farmers as it incurs the least share of input cost. Seed subsidy programs are also available in various parts of the country. He further explains taking the example of cotton, “an average farmer uses 2 packets of cotton seed per acre. The maximum cost of seed is Rs 2000 (at MRP – normally seed is available at a discount to MRP). He uses a minimum of 2 bags of urea, 2 bags of DAP and 1 bag of potash, making total cost incurred of Rs 4000. Further he spends on pesticides that exceed the cost to Rs 6000. Farm Labor is a minimum of Rs 6 per kg of cotton picked. So it is clearly visible that seed is the least expensive input. What is not understood / accepted by farmers is that all other factors being equal to his output is completely dependent on the quality of seed he uses”. Farmer awareness and field visit programs are a major part of the company’s product promotion. “To the extent of our abilities, we advise farmer on methods he should adopt to increase his yields, irrespective of whether he uses our products or not. Welfare by way of CSR is a regular effort of the company,” Mr. Rao adds. Ganga Kaveri Seeds aims to continue developing and introducing high quality seeds for the Indian farmers. Mr. Hanumantha Rao holds a BE in Electrical and he is an MBA from IIM, Kolkatta. Prior to Ganga Kaveri Seeds, he was associated with companies like L&T, NFCL, ITC and Bayer.
