This Mission would enable all households, urban and rural to gain easy and universal access to financial services. Exclusion from the banking system excludes people from all benefits that come from a modern financial system. In this Mission, households will not only have bank accounts with indigenous RuPay Debit cards but will also gain access to credit for economic activity and to insurance and pension services for their social security. I am happy to note that the Mission has a strong focus on the use of technology and incorporates lessons learnt from earlier efforts. I congratulate the Finance Minister and his team for their excellent effort in undertaking this ambitious task. I wish them all the success.
