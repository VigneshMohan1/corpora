We have experienced and quality scientific and technical man power in the food testing laboratory with world class analytical equipments and high quality man power, our food testing laboratory is one of its kind and unique in serving the food industries, research institutes and other stake holders in areas of food processing. Our Food Testing Laboratory is equipped to analyse the Physico-chemical characteristics of Food materials including raw materials and finished products. We have wide range of equipments to analyse Food composition, Textural properties, Viscosity, Elemental analysis and Toxin analysis in Food grains, Water analysis and phytochemical analysis in Fruits and Vegetables. Samples from different industries like Food Processing Industries, Edible Oil industries, Exporters & Importers and Pharma and Biotech industries and sent to us for analysis. The samples are analysed with the standard protocols like AOAC, AACC and BIS standards. The food testing industry works closely with manufacturers to ensure that all products are scientifically tested and proved to be safe for human consumption at a variety of stages, from raw material to production line, to finished product. Food testing can cover many aspects of the food manufacturing process. Most commonly, a common set of scientific techniques are used to analyse, assess and record the safety and viability of a product in terms of microbiological stability and chemical composition. Training We are giving short term training in handling of equipments like GC-ECD/FPD, GC-MS, HPLC, HPTLC, ICP-OES, Rapid Visco Analyser and Food Texture analyser to students and others.
