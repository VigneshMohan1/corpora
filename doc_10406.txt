Ground water level should be clearly stated in “liters per second” or “liters per day on the basis of number of hours of pumping. It is appropriate terminology to discuss about irrigation systems and enables to arrive at specific solution. Mr. Swastik from Hyderabad seeks advice on irrigations systems for irrigating his five acres of land. To this Mr. Morey first explains about types of irrigation systems available. Types of Irrigation Systems There are two types of irrigation systems. 1 Bringing water from some other source to the farm land for farming. 2 Using the water present in the farm land itself for farming. Mr. Morey explains, “in the first type of irrigation system where we have to bring water from some nearby river, stream, canal or any such source for watering the crops in the field we design and develop the canal system and lift irrigation schemes. We design lift irrigation systems which comprise of pipe lines and pumping arrangement.” He further adds, “in second type of irrigation system the water present under the farm land ground need to be used for irrigation requires the arrangement like piping for flood irrigation or drip and sprinkler systems for micro irrigation.” Guidelines for Selecting Irrigation Systems At Eastern Star Consulting Engineers before offering any irrigation solution to farmers, first different aspects related to crops and farming are discussed like specific conditions of water availability, crop and so on then after the farmer is provided complete guidance on irrigation systems. Government Subsidies Mr. Morey informs, “there are subsidies available from government for drip and sprinkler systems similar to subsidies offered for horticultural plantation, poly houses and shed net houses etc. Advantages of Drip Irrigation Every irrigation solution has its own advantages and disadvantages hence it totally depends on various parameters like crop, soil, ground level water etc, states Mr. Morey. Another member Mr. Dharmesh Patel maintains drip irrigation is suitable for all crops. It is ideal for agriculture in all means. He says, “drip is very good irrigation. It saves money, water and helps in getting good yield of all crops like vegetables, flowers, rice etc.” Less Water Consumption There are few methods enabling crops to survive and grow appropriately in very less water. Subsurface porous pipe micro irrigation system consumes less water than drip irrigation system. Mulching is also beneficial as it checks evaporation losses. ================================================================== Eastern Star Consulting Engineers Displeased with job, quits to start agriculture consultancy firm at Nashik, Maharashtra Yashpal Morey Eastern Star Consulting Engineers was started in 1980-81 at Nashik, Maharashtra by Mr. Yashpal Morey.
