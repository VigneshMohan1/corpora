It had previously stated that in the same period India’s GDP will grow by 7.5 percent but has now brought down the forecast to 6.2%. HSBC opines that in 2014 India will see a better growth rate of almost 7.4 percent – previously it had forecast 8.2 percent for the period. Leif Eskesen, an economist with HSBC, has stated that the year has started off on a weak note and reforms in the supply sector have been rather slow. The global economy is also taking a lot more time than expected to recover and all this has led to revaluate their previous growth forecasts. HSBC has also stated that there are plenty of difficulties in the Indian administration and domestic policies are in a paralyzed state. The bank feels that these factors will restrict the amount of investment being done in India and limit its economic progress in the immediate future. It feels that things can improve in the second part of the fiscal. HSBC opines that in the present circumstances the RBI might feel forced to take a step and reduce the rates. The changes are likely to be made on June 18, 2012 and there could be a deduction of almost 25 basis points. This will happen in spite of the consistent inflation. The bank also states that the rate at which demand is going up, there could be risk of further inflation. It has called for the economic structure to be reformed with greater efficiency and stressed that this needs to be done quickly. India’s GDP statistics for the first three months of 2012 were not at par with expectations. During April the rate of industrial production was pretty unimpressive as well when compared on a year-on-year basis and to March 2012. The fact that India has not been able to effect useful structural improvements has hampered its possible growth as well. In the final quarter the national economy grew at 6.1 percent and in the next quarter it came down to 5.3%, which is the lowest figure recorded after 2004. However, inflation rate is still pretty high in India. In May 2012, the WPI inflation increased to 7.55 percent as opposed to 7.23% in April. At present the CPI inflation rate is more than 10 percent. HSBC states that inflation rate can come down to certain extent owing to reduction in oil prices and moderate economic growth but the exchange rate is still weak and India’s overall economic capacity is somewhat restricted and all these factors can keep the inflation factor in play.
