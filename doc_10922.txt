The company exports mainly to Middle East, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Already established contacts in the overseas markets help them create demand. Maharashtra State Agriculture Produce Marketing Board also generates demands for them by forwarding them the demands that the Board receives. The consultancy has contract farming in Pune and alongside districts for supplying the said quantities of fruits & vegetables. An area for any produce is first identified. A survey is then done and farmers are contacted for contract farming. After terms and conditions are discussed, growership program is started. Growing is scheduled as per demand in the market. Mr. Belhekar admits business in fresh produce overseas is quite difficult. “Sometimes we do business only for the sake of market presence and to prove our quality. Establishing the brand is the foremost thing to do,” he adds. Competitors in the field hail from various countries like India, Philippines, Iran, Pakistan and other Asian countries. Quality and price are the biggest roadblocks that they face when it comes to competition from other countries. At present the consultancy is only adding up products to their basket for existing customers and trying to fulfill their demands. They will soon be starting a mushroom project along with “Flora Biotech” from Pune. They are looking for investors for this large scale project. Exotic mushrooms and medicinal mushrooms will be the mushrooms that this joint venture will deal with. Mushroom contract farming with mushroom byproducts are also on the cards. Shree Consultancy’s future plan is to increase activity in the vegetable sector and to launch the Mushroom project at the earliest.
