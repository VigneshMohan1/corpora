Web Promoter Scan Service WWW Promoter Scan Function : Predicts Promoter regions based on scoring homologies with putative eukaryotic Pol II promoter sequences. The analysis is done using the PROSCAN Version 1.7 suite of programs developed by Dr. Dan Prestridge , Information on PROSCAN, including details on obtaining a copy, is maintained at the Advanced Biosciences Computing Center , University of Minnesota. A DNA sequence is all that needs to be supplied. There are no optional parameters for PROSCAN. Please enter or paste a Nucleic Acid sequence to analyze (most formats accepted): Echo input sequence (generally recommended ) Be Forewarned! Patience is a virtue : Analysis for a 10Kbp sequence may take as long as 5 minutes (or more)!
