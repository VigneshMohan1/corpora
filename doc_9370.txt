Sanjeev Kumar Reply With Quote June 13th, 2013 #4 gouragrofarms Join Date May 2013 Posts 4 Dear Sanjeev, The market for this plant is still growing and we are working to market it as aggressively as possible. You can purchase the plants from us for your plantation. The yield is 4 tonnes per acre, from a total of 40000 plants per acre. The best thing to do to make your project scalable is to start with about 25 cents cultivation with a total of 10000 plants. The cost for getting a 1/4 acre project ready will be in the range of 5-6 lakhs depending on the cost of shade net that you install as a cover for the plants. As for buyers, there is a growing demand for this plant and buyers are becoming more and more aware. Currently there is no buy back arrangement for this plant. If you have any other questions, please reach out to me at costuspictus@gmail.com . Warm regards, Manu Reply With Quote February 13th, 2014 #5 kevindouglas Join Date Feb 2014 Posts 1 Thank you Manu for the recording. Apart from Gotomeeting, you can also try using RHUB web conferencing appliances to conduct webinars. It is easy to use and has no download of any kind; and moreover provides similar user experience as gotomeeting.
