SeedsAndCultivation   Rapid seed yam production (minisett technique) In this method clean and healthy yam tubers weighing about 1 kg are cut into cylindrical (disc-like) pieces, each about 5 cm thick. From each such piece, 2-4 small pieces (30 g) could be obtained by cutting the disc longitudinally or along the two perpendicular diameters. Such a piece is called a "minisett". The minisetts are then spread out under light shade for an hour with cut surface facing up before planting them in the nursery seedbeds. The minisett takes 2-3 weeks for sprouting. At this stage, they are transplanted to the main field at a spacing of 50 cm on ridges taken 1 m apart.   Top... WaterManagement   Top... NutrientManagement   Top... WeedManagement Top...
