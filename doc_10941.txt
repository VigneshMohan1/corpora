We are willing to provide consultancy and training in nursery techniques, cost effective organic farming techniques, and growing of chemical free high value vegetable crops under protected / semi protected conditions from germination to harvest Gautam Kar, proprietor of Emerald Farm belongs to the Indian Revenue Service and has retired as Chief Commissioner of Income-Tax. All through his service years he maintained his deep interest in gardening and farming. Emerald Farm is located on the outskirts of Nagpur, where several species of ornamental plants and high value vegetables like cherry tomatoes and colour capsicums are produced under controlled and partially controlled conditions without chemical fertilisers and chemical pesticides with inputs largely prepared in the farm. Gautam Kar has developed holistic methods of farming, keeping in mind the extreme weather conditions, water quality and availability, soil fertility, harmful and beneficial organisms present in farms, quality pressures and demands from markets, both at a local and national level. Having done his post graduation in Chemistry, when he began farming, he too relied heavily on enhancing performance of his crops cby using chemical based products. Soon he realized the vicious cycle that it creates and the larger impact that his practices were having on the ecosystem. He then started trying to meet the nutrition needed by plants by replacing the chemicals with natural substitutes. His practices are now a careful balance between techniques borrowed from Vedic farming to indigenous practices to sustainable practices to soil-less culture in highly controlled conditions. He has published articles in reputed journals on cultivation of roses and other ornamental plants and was invited as a delegate to represent India in the first SAARC Rose conference held in Jaipur. He is setting up a unit to provide training and consultancy to anyone interested in farming without chemical fertilisers and chemical pesticides and specialized training in growing high value vegetables. Knowledge inputs will range from basic principles of sustainable agriculture to special techniques for growing special crops to exposure to latest products and processes involved in organic farming.
