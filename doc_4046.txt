The Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering is administered jointly by the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources  and the  College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology . The BAE Department offers four options of study: Biomechanical, Bioprocessing and Biotechnology, Environment and Natural Resources, and Food Processing.   Biosystems Engineering courses integrate engineering sciences, physical sciences and biological sciences and teach students to address real-world challenges. Under the guidance of experienced faculty, students work both as individuals and in teams to design creative solutions to complex problems. The program culminates in a senior-year design course in which students integrate the analysis, synthesis and other abilities they have developed throughout the earlier portions of their study into a capstone experience.
