Pradhan – oil seed decorticator Invents machine for oil seed decortication “We visited many rural areas and observed collected seeds are dehulled manually. The traditional technique involves spreading seeds on hard base followed by moving a small wooden board over it. While pressing down, the fruit shells split and the seeds are obtained but consequently many seeds get crushed instead of being separated from the shell. Also the capacity and efficiency is very less, more labor intensive, drudgery to human labor, cause health hazard, etc. So I decided to mechanize the process and I got the idea to develop the machine to decorticate the oil seeds,” shares Dr. R. C. Pradhan the drive behind his invention. It took nine months to design and fabricate the machine. “After fabrication, we have tested for various oil seeds, which took another 6 months,” he informs. The machine is used mainly for non-edible oil seeds (NEO) like karanja, tung and jatropha etc. However it gives good result when used for dehulling groundnuts. When asked why a machine for non edible oil seeds, he says, “So far there is no equipment developed for NEO seeds. These oil seeds, source of biodiesel needs to be exploited as biodiesel has good prospects in India,” and also he says, “I also wanted to give solution to rural people for their oil seed processing problem. Mostly NEO seeds are collected and processed manually, low output producing method. If they process the seeds through machine, they can get better returns.” The oil seed decorticator works on principle of impact. In simple words, oil seeds are fed in the hopper. “There is an impeller type specially designed rotating blades inside the casing that results in high centrifugal force. The oil seeds are pushed inside the special designed wall where they break and get detached from the cover,” explains Dr. Pradhan. The machine runs through a 0.5 hp motor single phase. Minimum 500 grams of seeds are needed to start the machine. It processes approximately 40 kg seeds/hr. It is user friendly and does not require any training. “Brief demonstration showing the functioning of decorticator is sufficient. It is simple to open, dismantle and then assemble all parts. There is no need of maintenance. Only the ball bearing part needs greasing that can be done by a local cycle repair shop,” shares Dr. Pradhan. It can be used without hassles for 10 years and is not prone for any wear and tear even if not in use for a long time. Talking about commercial sale of the oil seed decorticator he says, “We did technology transfer to Swaraj Herbal, Lucknow in June 2014. It was done through IIT Delhi. Now the machine is available in UP market for commercial sale.” The machine is getting positive response from the buyers across India. “One of the buyers is based in Manipur. He uses the decorticator to process tung seeds, a potential tree-borne oil seed having many applications in paints, varnishes, and other non-food industries,” he adds. Price depends on manufacturer, he says and adds, “As it is designed for rural people it is priced accordingly.” Working with machines is a passion for the professor and hence in future he plans, “I want to develop an efficient machine for amla seed remover.” Dr. R.C. Pradhan is presently working as Assistant Professor in NIT Rourkela in the Food Process Engineering Department. After completing B Tech (Agricultural Engineering) he joined M Tech. Program in IIT Kharagpur in Post Harvest Engineering branch. Next he did his Ph.D at IIT Delhi in Center for Rural Development & Technology under the supervision of Prof. S N Naik. Decorticator for oil seed design is related to his doctorate syllabus but it is not part of it. Dr. Pradhan is the recipient of Jawaharlal Nehru Award (2012) for outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research.
