The crop yield level obtained by weeding during this period is almost similar to that obtained by the full seasons weed free conditions. The critical period of weed competition is also defined as the period between early growth during which weeds can grow without affecting crop yield and the point after which weed growth does not affect the yield. The critical period of weed competition is approximately 1/3rd of the duration of the crop.
