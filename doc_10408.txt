Based at Jalandhar, Punjab Jagriti-e-sewa was founded by Dr. J. S. Sandha. It started off as a self-supported citizen service enterprise to give government and non-government services to rural areas. This included services related to agriculture also, thus creating a very close link between the company and NABARD. An alumni of Punjab Agri University Ludhiana, Dr. Sandha has been receiving help from the university in designing the company’s services. Currently Jagriti is active in farmer guidance and value addition of farm produce. The turnover of the company is Rs. 3 Crores. It operates in Punjab, Haryana, J&K, Himachal, Delhi, UP, Gujarat and Bihar. Other states are being covered in phased manner and as per market demand. The company devised a road map for citizen services, especially for rural areas. Under the mentoring of Prof. Anil Gupta of IIM- Ahmedabad, it developed a complete model for reaching the public with healthy foods, based on stevia herb, packaged in modern formats that met the mobility needs of modern population. Jagriti then started a firm called Industrial Consultants and Laboratories (ICL). This new firm has the necessary VAT and food licenses. The company has about 22 foods based on stevia that is sold under its registered trade mark Steva. During 2008 it extended its portfolio by adding another line of health foods based on soyabean. This was done in association with CIPHET (Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Teach). “We found that soya had a great potential in India, especially due to vegetarian population. The protein from soya being much cheaper than any other source met the need to address protein deficiency,” says Dr. Sandha. Soya milk and tofu production were the first steps in this direction. More products such as ones made directly from milk and tofu, or from the by-products were later introduced. Jagriti has designed and developed its own soya milk machine that surpasses the Indian and Chinese machines by 60% in yield. The machine is under patent and will be released into market sometime in Feb 2014. “Stevia foods have sweeteners like table sweetener, sachets, sharbats and drops in a pen,” shares Dr. Sandha. In addition to these, more stevia foods are offered by the company. These include reconstitutable powders for making lemon, amla and bottle gourd drinks, tea coated with the extracts of stevia, tulsi, arjuna, ginger and sugar-free biscuits. Speaking of soya foods he adds, “we have their derivatives such as kheer, kabab and more products made from them. We also have dried tofu, and tofu based gravy thickeners that can be stored for as much as six months.” The waste produced from soya milk production is used for making protein biscuits, porridge, salted bhujiya and a host of other products. Stevia extract is procured from importers and soya from local markets in MP. The company is currently working with NABARD for promotion of soyabean cultivation in dry areas of Punjab and buy-back from farmers is a part of the plan. The products are sold to all age groups. Fitness-conscious people and the ones looking to prevent or manage diabetes, obesity, heart and hypertension are the major customers of the company’s products. The machinery offered by Jagriti have been designed keeping in mind the ease of operation, extraction efficiency, ease of service, rugged design, product safety and fitness for human consumption. Buyers are not just trained on production, but also on machine maintenance and repairs. Dr. Sandha holds M.Tech in Agricultural Engineering. He has been involved in various projects ranging with reputed institutes such as Punjab Armed forces, NABARD, BSNL, ECIL and many more.
