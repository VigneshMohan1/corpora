The objective for development of this software is to cover the gap in environmental data dissemination with regard to vast parameters such as air pollution, water pollution, forestry, land resources, flora and fauna, etc. In total there are 17 modules. Initially, the database consisting of 23 modules in various environmental fields was tested on pilot basis by Eight States with 12 modules in two phases. During the two phase of the programme, it was observed that there were some practical problems in collecting the data and filling the database software. After deliberations, it was decided that the existing 23 modules will be revisited and revised in consultation with all the States / UTs ENVIS Centres and to extend the ISBEID project for all the States / UTs.
