Go to the shop Abhinav Farmer Club Home Abhinav Farmer Club Farmers stand together to strengthen their power and reach buyers under ‘farmer to consumer’ initiative Mandar Ratnakar Walawalkar Abhinav Farmer Club was founded by Mr. Dhyaneshwar Bodke in Pune. The main goal of the club is to supply organic produce directly to the consumers, eliminating the middleman. A small initiative started in 2004 as one group with 10 farmers has today multiplied and reached an astonishing number of more than 300 plus. Abhinav Farmers Club spreads across various villages in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. All members of the club are organic farmers. Every group has maximum 20 members. Every group takes its own decisions and has one person who takes the lead. The vision of the group is to have at least one Abhinav Farmers Club in every district of India in order to supply organic vegetables, fruits, and grains to the consumers at affordable price and also to encourage marginal farmers to take up advanced and mechanized farming leaving behind the age-old farming practices. The group also believes in “Farmer to Consumer” supply chain and is working on it. “It is a bit challenging to work out the exact turnover of all the groups together but approximately it has reached up to Rs. 24 crores,” shares Mr. Walawalkar. Mr. Mandar Ratnakar Walawalkar, Member- Abhinav Farmers Club, has his own drumstick plantation of around 1200 drumstick trees on a leased land near Mumbai (110 kms). Being a resident of a metro and active member he takes care of marketing department of the club in Mumbai. He explains the procedure of growing and selling of organic produce, “First the group does the survey of the nearest residential area to understand the buying patterns and access to the requirements. Based on the findings, farmers grow the expected quantities in required frequency.” A few members take care of the farming while others do door-to-door marketing. The local women’s self help groups (farmers’ wives) take care of the harvesting, sorting, grading and packing of the farm produce which are delivered to the consumers by taking the orders one day in advance. In some places IVRS systems (developed by IIT Bombay) is in place to take orders. The group divides the profit after accounting for the different costs incurred. The group members are trained at Pune on new farming technologies and best practices etc. Farmer members get better resources for their input requirements such as seeds, organic fertilizers, and accessories. They share various responsibilities such as farming, harvesting, marketing, logistics etc that save them cost and time. They have access to many benefits from the government schemes and offers. Lastly, farmers get better returns compared to selling their produce in APMC markets. These are a few advantages a farmer attains by being part of Abhinav Farmers Club. Mr. Walawalkar informs, “We are yet to export our produce. Export has its own challenges like maintaining fresh quality as we work in a group and it is difficult to meet the export parameters. However, we are working on it.” The club is also in the process of taking organic certification but has some reservations regarding the cost and process of certification. Mostly in another three months all the members will be organically certified! Club’s achievements so far are that it got rewarded the first prize for farmers’ group from Finance minister Mr. P. Chidambaram and recently it also bagged IBN Lokmat (Marathi news channel) ‘Prerana Puraskar’ award from Shri Anna Hazare. Mr. Walawalkar is a science graduate (Geology) from Mumbai. He was into corporate training for 20 years before starting organic farming 4 years back. He signs off saying, “I was always attracted towards agriculture since my childhood. In corporate training, though an interesting field, I reached a saturation level and wanted to come out of the routine and explore something more challenging. Agriculture was the perfect alternative”. Our Correspondent Contact details: Abhinav Farmer Club 1104, Corsica C.H.S., Hiranandani Estate, Thane (W), Thane – 400 607. Maharashtra. India.
