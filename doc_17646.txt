Go to the shop Sdu Winery – Chickballapur district, Karnataka Home Sdu Winery – Chickballapur district, Karnataka Wine produced exclusively from company owned grapes to ensure quality SDU Winery was established by Ms. Shambhavi Hingorani, now the Director. She planted the first vineyard in 2003 in the Nandi Valley appellation. “There was shortage of good quality wine variety grapes, and the few wineries back then were willing to buy grapes from good quality vineyards.” adds Mr. Mohit Nischol, Business Head. “SDU winery is a boutique wine company. We believe in quality over quantity.” “At SDU Winery, we want our wines to represent the grapes primary expression. We ensure that the same unique characteristic is maintained throughout the winemaking process,” he shares. The company has 6 types of wines under its flagship in two ranges SDU Deva and SDU Reserva. SDU Deva is un-oaked style of wine which is fruity and easy to drink. There are 2 reds and 1 white under this range (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah & Chardonnay). SDU Reserva is an oaked type of wine more complex and heavy in palate. In this range too there are 3 types 2 reds and 1 white. Renowned Italian winemaker, Mr. Andrea Valentinuzzi is involved with the company in the wine making process. “Andrea has made changes in the yield of the vineyards to ensure we get the best quality grapes from our vineyards,” Mr. Nischol shares. “We do not outsource any grapes. The vineyards are owned 100% by us,” shares Mr. Nischol and adds, “This helps us to keep the quality in check.” The company owns 50 acres divided into two (named ID Halli & TG Halli) vineyards in Chickballapur district. Three varieties of grapes, 2 red and 1 white, are grown viz. Cabernet Sauvignon (Red grapes) Shiraz (Red grape) & Chardonnay (white grapes). The soil at ID Halli is gravelly red loam with some limestone of good depth and poor fertility good for the Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties. “The ID Halli vineyard has a mixture of clay and red gravely soils, ideal for growing grapes,” he shares, “The vineyard uses only drip irrigation to distribute water to the vines and is maintained and harvested by hand.” “The grapes are cared for throughout the cycle of growth,” he informs. Pruning is done at least 2 or 3 times during the growth period. Adequate nutrients are provided to the vines along with spraying of pesticides to keep the vines healthy. “We also make sure the yield per acre is regulated. This helps us to get good quality grapes during every harvest. The lower the yield the better is the quality,” shares Mr. Nischol, “We do not grow organic grapes.” The company has capacity for 1.5 lakhs liters winery and is currently producing about 8000 cases of wines annually. The wines are sold mostly in Karnataka, Goa, Pondicherry and Delhi. Outside India it is available in Nepal and Singapore. The company employs about 25-30 people from nearby villages for helping in the upkeep of the vineyards under the supervision of the viticulturist. “Grape growing for wine making can definitely be profitable for farmers in Karnataka. The weather actually suits the French varietals,” Mr. Nischol encourages. Also there are many wineries located in Karnataka looking for good quality grapes. “Farmers need to ensure that they have the right information and knowledge for growing these special varietals,” he advises. “Future plans are to launch 2 more wine brands this year and also to add new markets in India, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Maharashtra & Kerala,” outlines Mr. Nischol about the plans of the company.
