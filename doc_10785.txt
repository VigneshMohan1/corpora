It is said to be a healthy powerhouse. These ruby coloured gems are packed with so much nutrients that we at the organic farm try to boost its value to its fullest. Our organic sunkissed pomegranates grown on the lush slopes of the Western Ghats, bring out its authentic flavourand colour with no overbearing acidic taste.

We are continuing the celebration and you should too by choosing organic whenever you can to help keep the residues of conventional agricultural pesticides and fertilizers out of your food. A small tip; when refrigerated in a plastic bag, pomegranates keeps for up to 2 months. Try tossing the seeds on a salad for a brilliantly colourful, crunchy, and nutritious addition.
