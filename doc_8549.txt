Throughout South East Asia, various destructive, invasive mealybug pests have recently made their entry, threatening the cassava sector and livelihoods of some 8 million farming families. Public-private alliances help to boost farmers’ capacities to tackle new pests and diseases in cassava. The Managing mealybugs in cassava video and related audio files are downloadable from the Access Agriculture website in English - French - Bahasa Indonesia - Burmese - Khmer - Lao - Thai - Vietnamese . Currently, the video is distributed in the main cassava-growing regions through various media. In some countries, videos are broadcast on national television, and national extension offices are diffusing video material through their established channels. Many factories are mobilizing their networks of traders and technical personnel to project the video to cassava growers. An earlier study in Uganda showed that rice millers were the most active in organising video shows for farmers (see: Millers distribute and show videos ). After all, by providing an extra service to farmers they will attract more business.
