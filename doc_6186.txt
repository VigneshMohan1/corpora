The department of sericulture was created in the year 1889 under the monopolistic control of government to promote silk industry in the state. In this regard a very good infrastructure including mulberry nurseries, silkworm seed stations and silk reeling/weaving factories were established. Due to these efforts Jammu and Kashmir became one of the leading silk producing states. During those days sericulture was the only cash crop available to the farmers. By 1940, about 52000 families were engaged in this activity and the production of cocoon was as high as 15.00 lac kgs. Silk yarn apart from its use as a textile fibre, was being utilized as material for parachutes. Department of Sericulture functions under the control of Ministry of Agriculture, Govt of Jammu and Kashmir The main role of the department is to help farmers to adopt better technology and to facilitate establishment of infrastructure for farm production and marketing. New avenues are being explored for investment.   LATEST   Latest Happenings Transfer Report ending June-2014.pdf Transform Sericulture and Silk Industry intoaviable, profitable and sustainable enterprise STRATEGY FOR ENHANCED COCOON PRODUCTION Sericulture Mission       Dr. Malik Farooq DIRECTOR SERICULTRE J&K              Disclaimer This website is Designed and Developed by Agriculture Production Department and Hosted by NIC, J&K
