Get To Know Your Seafood MORE...   The U.S.—A Leader in Sustainable Seafood The United States is a recognized global leader in responsibly managed fisheries, aquaculture, and sustainable seafood. From Alaska to Maine to Texas, U.S. seafood is responsibly harvested and grown under a strong monitoring, management, and enforcement regime that works to keep the marine environment healthy, fish populations thriving, and our seafood industry on the job. Helping everyone—from chefs to consumers—understand sustainable seafood is important. Through FishWatch, we provide easy-to-understand facts about the science and management behind U.S. seafood and tips on how to make educated seafood choices.

A stock assessment is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting demographic information to determine changes in the abundance of fishery stocks in response to fishing and, to the extent possible, predict future trends of stock abundance. Managers use stock assessments as a basis to evaluate and specify the present and probable future conditions. Conceptually, this is similar to NOAA’s National Weather Service dynamic atmospheric models, which use multiple weather observations to calibrate complex atmospheric models that forecasters can use to make informed predictions. LEARN MORE...   Science Behind Seafood What types of data do scientists collect during fishery surveys? Scientists sort, weigh, and count species collected by each trawl, with an emphasis on collecting biological data for target species. They might also gather information on other species that might be of interest to NOAA’s partners, including scientists, agencies, and academic institutions. Scientists in Alaska are currently conducting surveys off Alaska’s coast. The two surveys—the annual eastern Bering Sea continental shelf survey and the biennial Gulf of Alaska continental shelf survey—will provide data needed for fisheries managers to determine sustainable fishery harvest levels.
