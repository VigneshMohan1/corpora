To establish the Access Agriculture web-platform, we receive technical backing from another world-leading company, Streaming Tank. Agro-Insight is a company established in 2010, based in Belgium. Its director has worked in public-sector agricultural research and development in Asia and Africa for the past 20 years. Agro-Insight is spearheading the zooming-in, zooming-out method that leads to the development and wide-scale dissemination and use of quality farmer-to-farmer training videos. Countrywise Communication , established in 1985, is a multi-award winning UK-based company specialising in video and multimedia production and training for agriculture, food and rural development. It has worked across the globe for the private sector, governments and public sector agencies, and has rich experience in assisting the production of local language versions of quality training videos. Streaming Tank is a UK-based company that specialises in live video streaming, WebTV, and rich media design and technology. Being technical advisors to YouTube, Streaming Tank prides itself in creating an enabling environment through Access Agriculture for people in developing countries with limited internet connectivity to still be able to watch and download training videos. Initial funding for Access Agriculture has come from Agro-Insight and Countrywise Communication with additional financial support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and helpful advice from many other organisations.
