Apparently I misremembered my last month’s time as 32:55. I was so sure of my previous PR this morning and when I wrote my previous post that I didn’t even click back to last month’s post until just now. No wonder I was a lot closer to the people just ahead of me this time. I was over half a minute faster! So yeah, the 3/1 minute run/walk Galloway method totally worked.

Tried a 3/1min run/walk this time. Felt a lot smoother overall, with a lot more room to grow and improve. Also today was colder than last month, and I was a lot closer to the people just ahead of me than I was last month.
