He has 16 years of experience in agri and allied subjects. Presently he is heading the department of agronomy at Natural Remedies in Bangalore. He is looking after the contract cultivation of medicinal plants. Natural Remedies, formally known as Indian Herbs, was founded in 1951 at Bangalore. It manufactures and supplies standardized herbal extracts, herbal compounds, veterinary, and healthcare products which are validated, effective, safe, and consistent. Company has R & D set up recognized by Department of Scientific and Industrial Research- DSIR. It has Government approved laboratory for testing of traditional medicines. It has 8 International Patents and nearly 100 publications in national and international peer-reviewed journals. There are three models for contract cultivation offered by Natural Remedies. First is Principal Farmer Model. In this, principal farmer takes the risk of mobilizing other farmers. He will collectively work with other farmers or farming groups and share the profits with them. The company will declare a price of medicinal plant to the principal farmer and in turn he will declare price with little margin to the farmer so that everybody in the loop will have the complete clarity and transparent benefit in this mechanism. The second model is Farmer Based Company. Many farmers and collectors are share holders of the company. They collectively do the farming and share profits. Good example of this model is Gram Udhyog Company Limited based at Madurai. The third one is Corporate Cultivation where company will use more than 100 acres and start cultivation of lot of plants. “These are the models we are using for contract farming. In contract farming we will fix the price before starting the cultivation so the farmers will have an assured income and they need to concentrate only on the productivity of the medicinal crop. Also all documents related to cultivation are maintained systematically,” Mr. Kammath shares and says, “we have plans to cover nearly 6000 to 7000 acres of medicinal plants cultivation. This year we have nearly 1000 acres for contract cultivation. We will provide the seed material to the farmers and our team shall visit the farmers once a week to provide them ideas on cultivation and harvesting.” The Excerpts: How contract farming of medicinal plants is beneficial for farmers? Medicinal plants and aromatic plants are the best alternate to the present agricultural system. There are erratic changes in the prices if the farmer grows vegetables or other plants. Further farmers near the bigger cities get the benefit as they set up nurseries and supply accordingly but the farmers in the far off places will not get such benefits. Medicinal plants are seasonal and 80% are one time uprooting where the content of the produce is seen and not the color of the product. Does the Government give any support? Yes, couple of Government agencies do give the support. One is National Medicinal Plant Body (NAPB) headquartered in New Delhi. Each and every state has got state medicinal plant divisions. Are there any subsidies available on medicinal plants cultivation? Government is giving lot of subsidies for the farmers and manufacturers. There are a few medicinal plants that are under threat and those are categorized as ‘RED’ plants. For these RED category medicinal plants government is giving nearly 75% to 80% of the cost of cultivation as the subsidy. For the regular items like ashwagandha and coleus, 30% to 55% cost of cultivation is given as subsidy. For the manufacturers Government gives Rs.15 lakhs based on the project. What will be the annual returns for the contract farmers? It depends on the plants and also the area. Farmers can get Rs. 50,000 and also up to Rs. 70,000 to 75,000 in a season for crops having the farming period of 3-6 months. It depends on the cultivation technology, site selection, and also the farming activity. What is  the minimum land required for contract farming? In one cluster we need nearly 50 acres to grow the common plants like ashwagandha, tulsi etc. It can be one single owner or a farmer can mobilize other farmers. As this is not one time activity there is a possibility of increasing the area of cultivation if all goes well. To go for contract farming, what should be the terms and conditions? First we should know the strength of the person and also the farmer should know about the company, the support given by the company etc. Time supply and quality supply will be verified and slowly orders are increased based on the trust. Does your company provide consultation? We don’t have a separate wing but as a corporate social responsibility we will provide guidance to the farmers whoever contacts us about the medicinal plants cultivation. What are the charges for the consultation? No, we are not charging anything. Only our field executive will visit farmer’s farmland and inspect once in a week. What are the plants that are best suited in Kerala? In Kerala and Mangalore labour cost is very high. They have to go for a valuable crop.
