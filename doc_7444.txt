The Research Station is situated within the municipal limits at Cuddalore, head quarters of Cuddalore district, at Semmandalam, 1.5 km away from Cuddalore Bus stand and Railway Junction, on Cuddalore – Panruti road. It has a cultivable extent of 44 hectares of land which includes roads and buildings. The soil type is clayey loam with pH of 7.2 and irrigated by bore wells. The major disciplines functioning are Plant Breeding and Genetics, Agronomy, Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Crop Physiology, Agricultural Entomology, Plant Pathology and Agricultural Microbiology.   Mandate To develop sugarcane varieties with high yield and high quality for different seasons. To carry out research for increasing sugarcane production in the coastal belt. To develop cost effective and adoptable sugarcane production techniques. To formulate integrated pest and disease management practices for sugarcane. Location         The Research Station is situated within the municipal limits at Cuddalore, head quarters of Cuddalore district, at Semmandalam, 1.5 km away from Cuddalore Bus stand and Railway Junction, on Cuddalore – Panruti road. It has a cultivable extent of 44 hectares and located at latitude 11 o 46’N and langitude 79 o 46’E.   The altitude is 4.6m MSL.     Technology Developed     PLANT BREEDING Fourteen early and ten mid late sugarcane varieties have been released from this Research Station.  EARLY – CoC 671, CoC 771, CoC 772, CoC 8001, CoC 85061, CoC 86062, CoC 90063, Co8021, CoC 91061, CoC 92061, Co 86249, CoC 98061, CoC (SC) 23 and CoC (SC) 24.   MIDLATE – Co 6304, CoC 774, CoC 775, CoC 777, CoC 778, CoC 779, CoC 8201, Co 8362, CoC 99061 and CoC (SC) 22.   AGRONOMY Short crop of cane (6-8 months age) records better germination than aged ones. Spacing at 80 cm    between cane rows brings out more cane yield. Press mud application @ 25 t/ha increases cane and sugar yields. The optimum seed rate for high yield is 75,000 double budded setts per hectare. Pre-emergence application of Atrazine @ 0.5kg a.i./ha, followed by hand weeding on 45 th day is effective and economical for weed control. Trash mulching on 3 rd DAP in sandy soils and on 21 DAP in clay soil is effective for soil moisture conservation, weed control and ESB control in addition to yield increase. Intercropping with blackgram and other pulses increases net income in addition to improving soil fertility status.   Application of herbicide Thiobencarb @ 1.25kga.i/ha only on the weeds (since sugarcane is sensitive to the herbicide) is effective for sugarcane crop intercropped with other crops.  Growing green manures like sunnhemp and daincha as intercrops in sugarcane adds nitrogen to the soil and increases cane yield by 10-15 t/ha. 2, 4-D sodium salt as post emergence spray applied on the weeds at the rate of 0.2% (2m/lit) controls the creeper weeds economically and effectively. Mulching ridges with raw press mud @ 25 t/ha records 85.5 per cent weed control efficiency. Irrigation once in 7 days at germination phase, 10 days at tillering and growth phases and at 13 days during maturity phase is found to be ideal for sugarcane. Drip irrigation in paired row system of planting (25x25x25x120 cm) and pit method of planting (4444 pits/ha) reduces half of the water requirement, controls weeds effectively; increases fertilizer use efficiency, increases cane yield and sugar yield. Detrashing on 5 th and 7 th months followed by propping increases cane growth and girth and ensures higher cane yield. Stubble shaving, shoulder breaking, gap filling and application of 25 per cent additional basal dose of N increases cane yield and juice quality in ratoon crop. Planting of sugarcane through mechanical cutter cum planter saves cultivation cost up to Rs.2500/ha. SOIL SCIENCE AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY Application of 275 kg N, 63 kg P 2 O 5 and 113 kg K 2 O per hectare is recommended for one hectare of sugarcane crop. Whole of Phosphorus needs to be applied as basal dose at planting and N and K need to be applied in three equal splits on 30 th , 60 th and 90 th day of planting in heavy soils (clayey soils) and in four equal splits on 30 th , 60 th , 90 th and 120 th day of planting in light textured (sandy) soils. 20kg Ferrous sulphate, 10 kg Manganese sulphate, 10 kg Zinc sulphate and 5 kg Borax mixed with 500 kg of compost per hectare is to applied in the soil as basal to overcome the deficiencies of micronutrients in sugarcane. The application of sulphur @ 60 kg S ha -1 in the form of Gypsum registered higher cane and sugar yields. The application of treated distillery effluent along with irrigation water @ 1:10 dilution increased the quality of cane juice i.e., Brix % and CCS%.     CROP PHYSIOLOGY Mulching the ridges with cane trash on 7 th month along with kaolin spray @ 2 per cent (12.5 kg/ha) on 120 days helps in overcoming the drought and ensures higher cane yield. The chemical ripener Sodium metasilicate @ 25 kg/ha as foliar spray on 10 th month increases the CCS per cent by 1.5 unit. The intensity of cane juice quality deterioration is very rapid from 40-96 hours after harvest   AGRICULTURAL ENTOMOLOGY Among the borer pests, early shoot borer ( Chilo infuscatellus ) causes damage even upto 60 per cent in young shoots during March to June. Trash mulching on ridges during 10 days after planting and intercropping green gram reduces the shoot borer incidence. Increasing the sett rate by 30% over the recommended rate effectively compensate the yield loss due to shoot borer damage in the late planted sugarcane crop The major natural egg paratasitoids on internode borer are Trichogramma chilonis and Telenomus beneficiens Release of Trichogramma chilonis egg parasitoid @ 2.5 cc/ha at fortnightly intervals six times commencing from fourth month onwards effectively checks the incidence of internode borer. Detrashing of cane during 5 th and 7 th months decreases the infestation of internode borer, mealy bugs, white fly, scales and Pyrilla. Dipha aphidivora predator @1000/ha or Macromus @1500/ha (larvae / pupae) can directly be advocated thrice at 15 days interval for the management of Sugarcane Woolly Aphid. Co C (SC) 23 is completely resistant to Sugarcane Woolly Aphid.   PLANT PATHOLOGY   Co 86249 is completely resistant to red rot ( Collectotrichum falcatum ) disease and CoC (SC) 23 CoC (SC) 24   moderately resistant   Smut disease ( Ustilago scitaminea ) has two epidemic periods viz. May to June and October to November and can be managed by aerated steam therapy @ 15 o C.   Sugarcane sett treatment is followed by mixing 125 g of Carbendazim 50 WP    250 g of Carbendazim 25 DS in 250 litre of water along with 2.5 kg of Urea and dipping the setts for 5 minutes   Top rot can be minimized by spraying Copper oxy chloride or Chlorathalanil or Mancozeb @     0.5 g/l Contact Us Dr.S.Nazeer Ahamed,Ph.D., Professor and Head Sugarcane Research Station Cuddalore – 607 001.
