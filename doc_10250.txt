It is election time and spare a thought  for farmers’ suicides! Not so good a picture for Indian agriculture UN Panel! The Congress party manifesto list would promises 10 crore jobs creation; bottom two-thirds of Indian population into middle class! Does anyone in the party apply his or her mind what it means to make such tall claims? There is not much substance on date, says The Hindu editorial! The aam aadmi, not the new party, but the common voter might not come to listen! There is so much disillusion about the ground level reality, corruption, bad governance etc. Indian economic development needs clear thinking, clear priorities.  We are not fully free market, now is our market regulated in a transparent way. The government regulates natural resources like oil, gas, coal, iron ores. So, we need transparent governance as ministers and men and women in UPA – II of integrity proved a disaster. Any alternative leadership is destroyed by blatant dynastic politics and family retainers the PM proved what extent he can subordinate to extra constitutional forces. So, this election must help to restore some internal balance in the policy and economy. The WTO has been approached by countries like Brazil and Argentina about India’s election-eve-dictated strategy of giving heavy food subsidies for winning the elections. Besides, there is also the big subsidy to raw sugar exports, the two subsidies, the US and other grain exporting countries contend, would distort international trade. When it comes to winning elections such populism as practised by the Centre and also by states like TN can win votes and help the governments to come back to power once more? The election scenario is changing faster this time. There is no guarantee the vote-bank elections would become a helping hand. The Congress is certainly set to lose this election. India stares at an agriculture loss worth Rs 42,000 crore ($7 billion) by 2030, due to the dangerous consequences of climate change, says the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its latest report. However, here is an expert view: Ruchir Sharma, Head of Emerging Markets, Morgan Stanley For once, India’s leading parties are engaged in an election debate about the troubled economy. The debate is focused inward, mired in misleading claims about which party has a better track record for managing the economy, and oblivious to India’s place in the world. The truth is that India’s economy tends to rise or fall with the global economy, not with the party in power. For virtually every five-year period since 1980, Indian GDP has grown at a rate of about 1.5 percentage points faster than the emerging world average. This somewhat faster growth has mainly come about because India is a low-income economy and it is easier to grow fast from a low base. Over the course of the last three governments, India’s average GDP growth rate has ranked somewhere between 40th and 50th place out of the 150 nations in the emerging world, whether Congress or BJP was in charge. The genuine Asian miracle economies, from Japan to Korea and China, were rising manufacturing powers that managed to put together long runs of rapid growth without always the help of global tailwinds. As yet, no Indian party has achieved that feat.
