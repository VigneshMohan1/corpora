http://localhost/seeds/Material/Seed_Processing.htm   SEED PROCESSING               Seed produced on growers field is taken to the nearest processing plant of the concerned agency at the farmers cost. Raw seed obtained at the plant might contain foreign matter like processing basically is removing all these foreign matters. This is an essential process to achieve the desired quality of seeds. Careful processing of seeds could separate the poor quality seeds from a seed lot. The left over is called low grade seed. The good seed so separated is tested for its purity and germination on the basis of prescribed standard. The lots which fail to satisfy these standards are rejected. Further there is a loss in weight due to drying up.               Processing capacity is calculated on the wheat seed basis, assuming 100 days of operation on double shift gain and 80% efficiency. Underutilization of processing capacity of processing plants results in higher overhead costs.   Back
