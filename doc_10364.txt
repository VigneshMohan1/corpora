Go to the shop Gaurav Deshpande – Fruit Farm Home Gaurav Deshpande – Fruit Farm Situated in the heart of Maharashtra is a 35 year old farm that currently specialises in growing a variety of fruits. It is run by Gaurav Deshpande, an MBA in Marketing from Nagpur University. Initially established by his grandfather Mr. Keshav Deshpande, this 25 acre farm started with growing pulses and vegetables and switched to fruits due to a high market demand and increased productivity. Oranges, Chickoos, guavas, mangoes and pomegranates are grown. Problems faced by Fruit Farmers : The most critical problem faced by fruit farmers is the absence of basic infrastructure like adequate water supply, the right labourers etc. Mr. Gaurav remarks, “Certain fruits like chikoo for example need lot of water. We had to change the entire irrigation system to Drip irrigation when we started Fruits farming. Also, the waiting period for any fruit farm is at least 3-4 years, i.e., if you plant a fruit farm in this year, you have to wait for at least 3-4 years for it to give you its 1st produce.” A major challenge is the perishability of fruits. The shelf life of chickoo is 4- 5 days, whereas for Mangoes its 8-10 days. To supply fresh fruit to the end user, a strong logistics system is the key . Future Plans :  The demand for fruits in India is consistently on the rise.  Speaking of their upcoming business plans, Mr. Gaurav elaborates, “We have started penetrating in Mumbai/Pune and other parts of western Maharashtra. And the response is very encouraging. Also we are aiming at penetrating in South India now. We see the demand is very high there and the supply is less. So we aim to make use of the opportunity.” Our Correspondent For more information contact : Mr. Gaurav Deshpande, trader and farmer,  Mob: 9819971614 Email: gaurvddeshpande@gmail.com Source : Agriculture & Industry Survey Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 5+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Gaurav Deshpande – Fruit Farm Related – articles, consultants, downloads Srinithi Agro Farm Mobile Enabled Farm Management Solution Sprout Natural India – Mushroom cultivation You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
