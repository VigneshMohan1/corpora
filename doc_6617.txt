NAF academies can take the form of small learning communities within larger schools or as stand-alone public high schools.  NAF currently has academies in 21 of the 25 largest school districts in the United States. NAF academies are organized around one of five career themes – Finance, Hospitality & Tourism, Information Technology, Health Sciences, or Engineering  –viable industries with demonstrated growth and strong potential in the years ahead.  In addition to core academic courses, students take industry-specific classes related to these themes and participate in work-based learning activities to put their lessons into action.   ShareThis Copyright © 2012 National Academy Foundation.
