She realized it much later that she is not born with skill to cut rather has an inherited talent to grow food. She ventured into farming following her father’s advice. Mrs. Lakshmi Devamma started her farming journey with 3 acres farm which has today expanded to 8 acres. The farm is located at Kanchahalli in Krishnarajpet Taluk in Mandya District. She was always in favor of mixed farming and says, “We do not waste the land space and never leave the soil unused.” Her mixed farming skills fetch her good returns from her farmland and have given recognition as Successful Woman Farmer as well. She has been felicitated with Samagra Krishi Award from Gandhi Krishi Vignan Kendra, Bangalore. The award is given to the farmers who are doing multiple farming related activities in same field. Sugarcane, ragi, paddy, coconut, papaya, fruits and vegetables are grown at the farm. In addition the farm also has forest trees. Biodigester is used for producing liquid manure for the crops. Dairy farming is another income generating feature of the farm. The farm has 180 coconut trees giving the yield of 2500-3000 coconuts. “We have 75 papaya trees and 500 banana trees. Every month we get half a ton (500 kg) papaya and approximately 20000 bunches of banana,” she informs. Sugarcane is grown round the year while ragi and paddy on rotation of 3 months. “When we grow ragi no paddy can be grown. Usually from January to July paddy is grown and from July to December we grow crops like ragi, avare, pulses, soya etc,” she adds, “All farm produce is sold in K R Pet market. We have farmer’s market on every Saturday and Wednesday where we sell the products in retail and on orders we receive.” Drip irrigation is used at the farm. Mrs. Lakshmi is always open for change and keen on doing alterations at her farm. She started growing maize as intercrop between coconut trees. She says, “We also started growing cabbage, tomato, flowers as intercrop. We earn about Rs. 10-15 thousand from the intercrops. This amount is useful for meeting our expenses.” She refers to her forest trees namely teak, silver oak, and mahogany as fixed deposits. The trees are grown at the farm border. “These trees are same as gold in value for farmers. Even after 30 years, we can get good returns. They do not require much water and even grow well during drought season,” she shares. She plans to sell these trees to wood buyers in future. Dairy farming is an intrinsic part of mixed farming model at Mrs. Lakshmi’s farm. There are 15 HF cows at the farm that produce 100 liters milk everyday which is supplied to KMF. “We receive payment once in a week. We get about Rs. 8-10 thousands as profit after all expenses. Totally we may get about Rs. 40 thousands as income,” she shares. Dairy unit also helps in producing organic manure. Taking the subsidy from agriculture department Mrs. Lakshmi installed bio-digester at the farm to produce liquid manure for the crops. She explains, “We have one tank full of water to which we add cow dung and other farm waste. All these are left to decompose. Later it is filtered to another tank and added to water which is then released in the farm as liquid manure for plants.” She took this initiative to reduce the dependency of chemical based farming inputs. Bio-digester helped to reduce the cost and increase the yield. She proudly shares, “The sugarcane yield increased to 80 tons/acre. Last year the sugarcane produce at the farm was 600 tons.” She is contended with her decision of becoming a farmer instead of tailor. Now her husband Mr. Ramakrishna, retired postmaster, has also joined her farming business. The couple have dedicated themselves to farming. Approximately Rs. 10-12 lakhs is their annual income. Mrs. Lakshmi Devamma’s farm constantly draws attention of scientists and agricultural officers for her mixed farming activities that has made farming sustainable and stimulation for others!
