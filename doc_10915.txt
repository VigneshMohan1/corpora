Go to the shop Shivrai Technologies – software to manage farms Home Shivrai Technologies – software to manage farms Technocrats develop customized ERP farming solutions “Increasing global competition and growing concern over food safety and quality have made it almost mandatory for Indian farmers to follow professional and scientific farm management practices,” views Mr. Santosh Shinde, Founder Director and COO, Shivrai Technologies. Hence the company was founded as a partnership firm in 1996 and later on incorporated as a private limited in 2006 with a vision to “develop innovative Information and Communication Technology products and solutions.” The company is located at Pune, Maharashtra. The founders are Mr. Sanjay Borkar and Mr. Santosh Shinde. The array of software solutions available at Shivrai Technologies are FarmERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) for managing farms of all sizes, FarmERP Biotech for managing tissue culture laboratory operations and FarmERP Agri-Service pro for managing soil and water testing laboratories. “Indian software industry has grown tremendously, but unfortunately there are no software/mobile tools available for small holding growers,” shares Mr. Shinde and adds, “and use of information technology tools, software, Internet etc. has become unavoidable.” Hence agri IT tools were developed with the idea to enable Indian farmers to benefit from the IT revolution. FarmERP has had over 100 installations. “The company envisages this product as their flagship product,” shares Mr. Shinde. The software is offered over cloud-based system in regional language. It is available in different customized forms as per the requirement of the customer at a good range of price. Online help as well as support team are available to troubleshoot any problem that arises. The ERP software helps farm owners in increasing operational efficiency, faster analysis and decision making, saving costs, and getting more profits. The software assists in having complete control over business processes and real time information. It can generate reports compatible to formats prescribed for GlobalGAP. The software also enables users to get personalized crop schedule and maintains history of practices. The company’s target customers include corporate farms, private farms, government farms, co-operative farms and contract farming companies. “Awareness is created through emails, Google ads, articles published in various newspapers and through our existing customers,” shares Mr. Shinde. “In the absence of collective and coordinated efforts by the institutions, ICTs have not penetrated rural India despite time, money and efforts invested so far,” says Mr. Shinde as one of the major challenges. Lack of relevant and ready to use content in local languages, absence of decision support system, mobile utilities and MIS software are the other setbacks suffered. “Initiatives of NIC and ICAR may have to be pursued jointly by all the public institutions,” voices Mr. Shinde. The company looks forward to reach out to more number of people globally and make FarmERP available at their disposal. “Shivrai’s mission is to become a global leader in this domain and make FarmERP products and solutions available across the globe,” adds Mr. Shinde. In this regard the company is interacting for prospects in countries in Middle East, Africa, USA, Thailand etc. Both Mr. Santosh Shinde and Mr. Sanjay Borkar hold Engineering Degree in Computer Science.
