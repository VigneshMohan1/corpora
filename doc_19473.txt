India, a union of states, is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a parliamentary system of government. The Constitution of India, adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, came into force on 26 January 1950. India comprises 29 states and seven union territories. The States Reorganization Act of 1956 was a primary force in reorganising the boundaries of Indian states along linguistic lines, and bringing an amendment in the Indian Constitution whereby the three types of states, known as Parts A, B, and C states, were amended to a single type of state. Though additional changes have occurred in the state boundaries since 1947, the Act is still considered as an undisputed player in providing the present shapes and contours of the Indian states. In November 2000, India gained three new states - Chattisgarh carved out of Madhya Pradesh, Uttaranchal out of Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand from Bihar. The Constitution distributes legislative powers between the Parliament and state legislatures. The Parliament is bicameral - the lower house is known as the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the upper house is known as the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). At state level some legislatures are bicameral and are run along the lines of the two houses of the national Parliament. A land blessed in all terms, be it topography, natural beauty, population, religion, culture or language, India is home to twenty nine states and seven union territories. All the states and union territories are unique in their own ways. Having an extraordinary history and culture, all the states and union territories in India never fail to charm their visitors with their unfolding mysteries and charisma.
