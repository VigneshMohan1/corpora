Located at Jaipur, Rajasthan Sushil Agro Services was established in 1978 by Mr. Sushil Chhabra. It deals in farm equipments. The company specializes in ‘Chaff Cutter Machines’ and ‘Disc Harrow’. “I am a mechanical engineer, and so I found it very interesting to manufacture farm machines,” says Mr. Mohit Chhabra, Business Manager (Son), enthusiastically. “We have the widest range of chaff cutter machines,” he adds. “The new chaff cutter models are less costly, better output, low maintenance, so low running cost, easily available spare parts, and ‘value for money product’ for farmers, ” says Mr. Chhabra. For chaff cutter, the company has models which can be operated manually with motor or tractor. It also has a model one-third the usual size with a safety device and operated by 2/3 hp motor giving the output equivalent to a 5 hp model. The company is also working on a high speed model that will be able to give twice the output of the biggest model available. “This Indian model will be almost one-fifth the price of its imported counterpart,” shares Mr. Chhabra, “To suit the budget of the buyer” models available at Rs. 20000-21000 are offered at Rs. 15000 and those at Rs. 12000 are offered at Rs. 7000-8000. “We are the pioneer of developing small size ‘Harrow’ for 15 hp mini tractors,” informs Mr. Chhabra. The company has also launched Disc Harrow for small tractors. It is now working on a new model; “This model will do the better ploughing of field with fewer loads on tractor and will change the style of ploughing,” he adds. “We compete on the basis of relationship,” says Mr. Chhabra, “So even if farmers are not buying from us, they are in touch with us to take information on other issues and products.” A farmer can avail subsidy for purchasing the equipment depending on the scheme issued by the state and centre government. Like in Rajasthan, machine tested by Govt. approved testing centers can be bought with subsidy from Kraya Vikraya Sahakari Samiti (KVSS) or Gram Seva Sehkari Samiti (GSSS). “It is accepted that the subsidy model in Rajasthan is very appreciable and should be followed by other states also,” Mr. Chhabra voices his opinion. “We participate in exhibition and give demonstrations at GSS or KVSS exhibit to create awareness on our farm machinery and related products,” shares Mr. Chhabra. The company also participates in events by agriculture department; gives live demonstrations in field with small farmers’ group and give trials at the factory. The challenges faced by the company include the different needs and requirements of the buyers. “Catering to all these changes is a big challenge,” says Mr. Chhabra. “We want to develop some new and altogether different products. We want to work for the betterment of the farmers without looking for any profits,” he concludes. The company endeavors to add some advanced technology to agricultural machines. Mr. Mohit Chhabra is a science graduate and has MBA Finance and CFA.
