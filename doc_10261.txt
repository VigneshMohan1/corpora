Located at Ripponpete, Karnataka Ananthamurthy Javali Ankur Nursery was started 10 years ago when water source was struck, in 13 acres dry land at Ripponpete, Shimoga Dist. of Karnataka. Mr. Ananthamurthy Javali, Proprietor reminiscences with a few lakhs of working capital obtained from gramin bank, plants such as, vanilla, areca nut, pepper, appimidi- a native wild pickle mango variety, were being produced and those times farm labor was available in abundance. The profit obtained was reinvested to develop infrastructure for the nursery. During the course of time 1,500 Nilumbur teak, 1,000 Shivane, Mohogany trees were raised. With change in time, today activities at Ankur Nursery are limited to the propagation of varieties of Jack-fruit grafts, Appi midi- pickle mango grafts, from our own mother-plants. 2,500 Pepper vines have been established on the Teak, Shivane trees. Jack Fruit Jack-fruit tree survives for centuries without intensive irrigation and care. With selected varieties, yield of 50 tones/acre every year can be obtained. “It is free from pesticides and can be used as vegetable, fruit and processed into value added products such as pappad, chips, halwa, jam, juice, jelly, pickle etc. Various types of Jack-fruit plants, based on color, size, yielding season, purpose of particular use are propagated,” informs Mr. Javali. Teak Plantation Teak plantation in Karnataka can be done without many hassles in production. However, the administrative harassment while obtaining felling permit, sawing permit, transportation permit deter farmers to grow teak in their farmlands. “It is optional to grow trees in farmlands, but there are laws to punish the tree growers (IPC sections),” shares Mr. Javali. He furthers adds, “personally, I failed to obtain permit to saw and use the wind fallen trees in my plantation, for which I had applied 5 years ago. It is very difficult to fight against the administrative excesses in our democracy! Teak has good demand in our country. One can see huge piles of imported timber in our sea-ports. The demand shall continue to increase because the farmers are afraid to cultivate teak trees.” Future Plans “I continue to prepare Jack-fruit grafts because, Jack-fruit is going to be the “food security bill “without burden of the bill on common man,” concludes Mr. Javali.
