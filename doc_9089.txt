In the bargain we also get honey. It has been a part of organic farming for a long time, so much so we could even imagine a farm with no bee hives 40-50 years ago.

Hence, environment friendly measures like use of honeybee and other bio-pollinators can be used. Additionally their use will help farmers getting much needed additional income through sale of honey.

But my real worry is every bee should return to her home back.

Churi, Managing Director & Mrs. Anjali Makarand Churi, Director Operations & Technical says- Honey Bees are best to pollination and increase production in a big scale. Farmers get honey for sale; if you do not spray then honey bees remain. It's really advantageous to increase production, especially for fruits. Nisarg Nirman Agro Products Pvt.
