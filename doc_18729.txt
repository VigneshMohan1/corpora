Delhi Metro Map Delhi Metro Phase 1 and 2 Gurgaon Metro Map Delhi Metro Stations Delhi Metro Phase 3 Central Secretariat to Kashmere Gate Dwarka to Najafgarh Jahangirpuri to Badli Janakpuri to Kalindi Kunj Mundka to Bahadurgarh Mukundpur to Shiv Vihar Badarpur to Faridabad The introduction of the metro rail service in Delhi has changed the face of transportation in the national capital territory of India. The metro has been specifically designed keeping in mind the comforts of the passengers and the traffic on the road. The metro rail service in Delhi has been appreciated all over the world. The metro railway network has covered almost the entire city and with continuous endeavours towards expansion, most of the neighbouring areas and suburbs will also be covered by the metro railway by the end of 2021. The metro rail service has proved to be a boon for the people of the union territory. The best thing that has happened since the introduction of the Delhi Metro is the reduction in Delhi’s traffic and pollution levels. The expansion plans of the Delhi Metro started especially for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Although the Delhi Metro is not the first metro railway in India, it can be said to be the first of its kind in the country. Constructed with utmost architectural brilliance and state-of-the-art facilities, the Delhi Metro is very different from the other metro rails in the world. Apart from being technologically sound, the major aspect that has been given prime importance within the Delhi Metro is security. The Delhi Metro is being constructed in phases. Most of the routes under Phase I were completed before 2010. The second phase, known as Phase II, covered 85 stations. It was also successfully completed by the end of 2010. The other projects in the pipeline are Phase III and IV, which are expected to be ready by the end of 2016 and 2021 respectively. The Delhi Metro stations have small kiosks that provide food and beverages to the commuters. Some stations like Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, etc., have popular food outlets like McDonald’s, Nirula's, Cafe Coffee Day, etc. IRCTC has also opened a set of food kiosks that serve passengers with snacks and delicacies at reasonable rates. The kiosks (Food Tracks) offer light snacks and mini meals. In the interim budget of the 2014-15 fiscal year, DMRC received a budgetary support of Rs. 3,470.16 crore and Rs. 838.07 crore as equity. In the 2013-14 fiscal year, DMRC was granted Rs. 2484.18 crore as the budgetary support and Rs. 650 crore as part of equity investment. To provide better services to its commuters, the Delhi Metro has taken certain initiatives. These are listed below: Introduction of six- and eight-coach trains on several routes. Besides the existing eight-coach trains plying between Jahangirpuri and HUDA City Centre, new such trains would be made operational. This has been particularly done because during the rush hours in the morning, the Rajiv Chowk metro station gets two out of three trains having eight coaches. Additional trips on the route between Kashmere Gate and Gurgaon between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. have been introduced. Similarly, additional trains have been introduced on the Janakpuri West to Vaishali route and the Noida City Centre to Dwarka Sec-21 route, respectively.
