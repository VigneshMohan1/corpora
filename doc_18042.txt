Nestled among the jungle-clad hills and verdant plains are the various national parks of Assam. When we speak of India's national parks, the first name that inevitably crops up in our minds is that of Kaziranga National Park. One of the countries leading national parks, the Kaziranga National Park has been accorded the statues of the elite UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is possibly Assam's oldest and foremost national park that is located in Golagaht District and is renowned for housing the nearly endangered species of the Indian one-horned rhino and the Hollock Gibbon genus of apes. Another eminent World Heritage Site, the Manas National Park is credited to be Assam's sole Tiger Reserve Project that is housed at the picturesque meeting point of the Himalayan foothills and the Manas River. However the sanctuary also houses several other species of wildlife and variegated birds apart from the majestic predator, the Royal Bengal Tiger. The Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is shared between the districts of Dibrugarh and Tinsukia and happens to be the state's fourth national park that houses several unique species of wildlife and birds. Nameri National Park laced by the Jia Bhoroli River has an unmistakable charm that can be attributed to the lofty jungle-clad hills, sylvan water bodies and dense forests. Orang (Rajiv Gandhi) National Park that shelters several rare and near-extinction species of animals and birds has been bestowed with the honor of a mini Kaziranga National Park.
