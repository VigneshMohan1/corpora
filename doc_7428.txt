It was identified as one of the centers’ of All India Coordinated Research Project on Forage Crops by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in 1971. A full fledged department, first of its kind in India came into existence in the year 1976 at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore. The lofty guidance left behind by the predecessors has scrupulously been followed and hence the Department of forage Crops is the apostle of research wisdom and wellness. It’s a merit to mention that TNAU has so far released 22 high yielding fodder crop varieties/ hybrids including two national (All India) varieties for general cultivation.  Among them, Cumbu Napier hybrid CO (CN) 4, Guinea grass CO (GG) 3, Multicut fodder sorghum CO (FS) 29 and Lucerne CO 1 are very popular among the farmers of Tamil Nadu and neighboring states.   Subpages (8): Books Contact us Faculty News Objectives Package of Practices Research Varieties  © CPBG and  Maintained by  Dr. N.Manivannan Sign in | Recent Site Activity | Report Abuse | Print Page | Powered By Google Sites
