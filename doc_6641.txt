Teachers and school administrators, likewise, find inspiration for their efforts in academy students’ descriptions of the sense of belonging, support, and strong motivation they get at school. Enjoy these glimpses into what an academy experience looks like from the point of view of our most invested and engaged partners. Have a story to tell?  Share it with us!   Read Student & Alumni Stories. . .     ShareThis For Students & Alumni Alumni Week 2014 Student & Alumni Stories College Resources Scholarships Copyright © 2012 National Academy Foundation.
