Pest Management - Small Farms / Alternative Enterprises - Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension Main Page About Us Extension Offices EDIS Publications Conference Info Pest Management UF/IFAS Publications | Publications from Other Universities and Federal Agencies Organic farmers manage pests through a variety of means. Preventative strategies including sanitation, rotation, and variety selection are made well in advance to carefully avoid expected pests. In addition to avoiding pests, producers employ tactics to exaggerate naturally occurring control mechanisms, such as attracting beneficial insects. Although a number of natural pesticides are available for organic crops, producers are obligated to use all possible cultural and biological means of pest management first, before applying any pesticides. Successful producers use many complimentary control strategies at once to provide strength and flexibility in their pest management plan.
