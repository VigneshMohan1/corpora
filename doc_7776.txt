Tantek Çelik Tantek Çelik Independent technologist, writer, teacher Search @phidip #NPSF is @Nov_Project_SF , SF chapter/tribe of november-project.com — a free workout group. Last Wednesday of the month is our "PR Wednesday" where we do a particular routine and try to set a new personal record time to completion. More on NPSF’s PR Wednesday routine in this previous post: tantek.com/2015/119/t1/personal-record-npsf-pr-faster 15:49 on 2015-05-28 Actually I did set an #NPSF PR this morning! 33:20 = 35s faster than 33:55 last month! Apparently I misremembered my last month’s time as 32:55. I was so sure of my previous PR this morning and when I wrote my previous post that I didn’t even click back to last month’s post until just now. No wonder I was a lot closer to the people just ahead of me this time. I was over half a minute faster! So yeah, the 3/1 minute run/walk Galloway method totally worked. 21:20 on 2015-05-27 #NPSF PR Wednesday this morning: 33:20, 25s slower. Tried a 3/1min run/walk this time. Felt a lot smoother overall, with a lot more room to grow and improve. Also today was colder than last month, and I was a lot closer to the people just ahead of me than I was last month.

As long as a native iOS app is not asking to be updated, then it seems mostly harmless. However, most so-called "native" mobile apps are more work for the user (thus more unfriendly) by making the user deal with: * update notifications * explicitly needing to update them * having them be disabled (Waiting…) while being updated * making device backups take longer On the other hand, the nice thing about web app shortcuts is that they never need explicit updating, nor do you have to wait for such updates to finish before you can use them again, nor do you have to deal with any of the other above-noted native app annoyances. 23:11 on 2015-05-25 going to Homebrew Website Club 17:30 @MozSF 2015-06-03.

You’re right regarding “You have to walk before you can run.” Some thoughts on that: http://indiewebcamp.com/generations @IndieWebCamp is a community that encourages and helps enable everyone to walk and run who wants to do so, especially with their own identity and creativity, incrementally, step by step.

Grateful for #running #baytobreakers with so many friends, #NPSF LAX BOS NYC. #b2b104 23:13 on 2015-05-18 ran #baytobreakers in 1:17:53. ~3 minutes slower than last year. #b2b #b2b104 #noinjuries #noexcuses More: Transited by bus halfway with a couple of @nov_project_lax friends and then we did a ~2 mile warmup jog before the race to the corral entrances, stretched in the corral, and then bounced to stay warm with fellow @nov_project_sf runners. We started the race on time near the front of Corral A, can’t say anyone got in my way, people in general were faster than me. I kept pace with my friend @leahculver for the first mile which was my fastest of the whole race. Despite feeling prepared, I felt like I was dragging and heavy for the whole race. Even the downhills didn’t feel as speedy as I’m used to. I tried not to let those feelings get to me and pushed on regardless. Still, I could tell by mile 4 that I wasn’t making the time I wanted to, and wasn't sure I would even be able to beat my last year PR (personal record). I thought to myself regardless of any doubts, I owed it to myself to give it my all, so that I could at least finish knowing that I did, regardless of whether I PR'd or not. So I did, and I still fell short of my goal(s) for the day (except I did finish free of injury at least). I’m not going to make any excuses, yet I have to admit, after consistently making progress the previous four years, and crushing it last year, I was disappointed with my performance today. I’m going to attempt to make the most of it, by reflecting on and writing down what I did (or did not do) that I might/could/should have done differently. Despite giving it my all on raceday, that’s only part of giving it your all for the race, whether last night, yesterday, last week, or in the months of training beforehand. It’s just over two months before my next race (the second half of the San Francisco Marathon), and I’m going to consciously plan for and put whatever insights I come up with to use from tomorrow until then.

I don’t remember feeling this miserable during a PR-Wednesday workout in a long time. But first the times: * 2:07 faster than my previous PR-Wednesday record 36:02 (2015-02-25) * 1:30 faster than my course record 35:25 (2015-01-13, before the course became our PR-Wednesday workout) The previous two months I did both the 5:30 & 6:30 PR-Wednesday workouts as well as the “tweeners” in-between workout. Those times: tantek.com/2015/084/t1/npsf-double-pr-wednesday Feb: 36:02 & 36:15 Mar: 38:32 & 37:04 Since February of this year, the NPSF Alta Plaza PR-Wednesday workout has consisted of: 1. start at the bottom of the steps on Pierce. 2. run a clockwise lap around the park 3. run up steps to the flat area between the playground & tennis courts 4. 10 burpees 5. run back down the steps 6. repeat 2-5 two more times 7. repeat 2-3. For a total of 4 laps, 30 burpees, ??? steps, as fast as you can. Things I did differently beforehand for this morning: * Last night: iced my knees — no pain, just a little swollen from Tuesday track ( ttk.me/t4at1 ) * 5:49 put on my newer racing ASICs instead of old training pair or Nike Structure 18s. * 5:50 rungang (warmup run ~2 miles) to 6:30 @Nov_Project_SF instead of driving to doubling-up 5:30 & 6:30. * ~6:15 downed a Starbucks single espresso on the run to Alta Plaza (having had nothing to eat at home but a couple of chewable vitamin Cs). During the PR workout this morning, there were three things that I distinctly remember doing differently, and feeling more mentally and physically miserable about. 1. Ran (no walking) up the entire West side hill (first time) on lap 1, legs shaking at the top, thinking, I'm not even half a lap in yet. 2. Second time up the steps, I raced them hard two at a time to the top (thanks to a serendipitous music boost), and then almost felt like throwing up while doing burpees after. Actually felt that during all subsequent burpees. 3. Third lap, on the North side downhill, sprinted to the point of losing my breath (was inspired to pass Gil and Jorge on the downhill, each on their fourth lap, who then passed me back on the East side downhill when I had trouble breathing & running at the same time). 4. Not what I did, but what a friend did for me: Fourth lap, my friend Matt Schaar ran with me (he’d finished his workout already), verbally encouraging me and anyone else nearby the whole way. I’ve said it before ( ttk.me/b/4Yy2 ) and I’ll say it again ( ttk.me/b/4_n1 ), this is an incredibly positive, inspiring, and supportive group to run and workout with. from fb.com/media/set/?set=a.632064620263368.1073742040.276430682493432 However, the entire workout I felt like I was going either slower or no faster than before. I felt like I was having an off day. A miserable off day. But stubbornly I wasn’t going to give up. Instead, I pushed harder to just get it over with. And ended up going faster. I should emphasize, none of this involved any kind of pain threshold (as far as I remember). No knee pain nor ankle pain. (Well maybe a bit of suppressing a lingering sidecramp from my Sunday 7 mile trail run). Apparently it was all about pushing myself further into both psychological and physical discomfort than I had before on a PR day. It’s going to be interesting facing that next month, when I know that that’s what it’s going to take to both go that fast, and to have even a chance of PRing again. Fortunately I have a different race focus before then: Just 18 days til Bay to Breakers (2015-05-17) - where I’ll have a different mental challenge. Last year I cut over 16 minutes ( ttk.me/t4W81 ) from my B2B time (thanks to six months of NovemberProject). This year I've had twelve more months of NP and I honestly have no idea what is a reasonable expectation. I’ve had some thoughts, like cut five minutes, get a sub-1:10 but I’m trying hard to focus and concentrate on just beating last year’s time and giving it all I’ve got, finishing with the knowledge of having done so. 18:45 on 2015-04-29 Congratulations @benwerd @erinjo !

Made up for it afterwards. Also it was a much colder than expected morning. Like hurt your lungs cold when you inhale too deep. They didn’t feel warmed up until after the second 1600. Still, made good times according to Nike+ Running so I’ll take it. Another solid track workout in the books. I’m counting this as having done the whole thing even though I swapped the first 400 to after abs.
