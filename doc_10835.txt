Solar bright sun Light during day time 2. Solar PV Panels (MNRE approved) mounted on Array structure made out of powder coated steel 3. Eminent Solar Pump inverter (solar pump controller/VFD inverter) with advanced highly efficient MPPT solar charge controller. Pl note that this Solar Pump Inverter are specially designed and capable ofwithstanding heavy load current (surge type) taken by water pumps whereas normal Solar Hybrid inverter could not withstand surge currents 4. (OR) 7. Conventional AC single phase water pump (OR) Submersible bore well pump on open well. 5. Water outlet for irrigation or Gardening 6. Solar Panel earthling 7. Conventional AC Govt. power supply Working principle This solar pump controller prioritizes DC current input from solar PV panel and converts into 230V AC current and keeps the water pump running throughout the day .Only when solar light is bad/absence/cloudy weather/night time, it automatically takes power from conventional EB source. This way the power cost towards operating water/bore well pump will be drastically reduced Highlights 1. Available in Power Range from 1hp to 15hp 2. Customized Programming Facility like Tank Water Level 3. Inverters with Solar Water Pump Control Option Control, Pump Dry Run Protection, Low Speed Slip function etc. 4. Total KWh/Power generated by Solar PV Panel Recording Features Solar Pump VFD 1. Automatic Start/Stop of Pump Motor based on Irradiation of Sun. 2. Delay auto restart logic for drip irrigation systems. 3. Dedicated reduce torque control mode for Pump Operation 1. Powerful PC Software 2. Easy commissioning and monitoring of Water flow ofpump and Power generation / utilization of PV module. 3. In-Built Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Control System. 4. Optimum Power utilization of PV Solar Panel 5. Control and changes Output of Inverter as per demand and availability of Power from Sunlight. 6. Saves Money and Fuel during Daylight Hours The Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) ensures you to get the best output Power possible from your Solar Panel and it maximizes the performance of your Pump along the day while the automatic start and stop with solar radiation can save money and fuel during daylight hours. Solar Pump inverter has In-Built MPPT Control that Provides the best compromise between Convergence Speed, Efficiency and Performance- thus gives the best possible output from the pump The price range for solar pump controller to operate your surface water pump/borewell pump of 1 Hp to 10 HP will be Rs 32,000 to 69,000/- Approx. and all other essential accessories like Solar PV Panels(MNRE approved),Arraymounting structure,Earthing ,cables & connectors will also be supplied at reasonable and nominal extra cost with sharp discount for farming community If you have any questions fill the product enquiry form above.
