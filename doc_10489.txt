Annually develops 2000 plus goats Mohsin Shaikh Osmanabadi Goat Farm is based at Latur, 60 km away from Osmanabad in Maharashtra state. Mr. Mohsin Shaikh is the Owner and Chairman of the farm. The farm specializes in breeding and supplying Osmanabadi breed goats. It also conducts researches and participates in a number of initiatives to constantly develop goat farming industry. The farm accelerates growth through innovation and strengthening organizational and associates’ capabilities. Recently, the efforts of the farm were recognized and awarded by CII Delhi and Krishi Expo held at Nagpur in February 2014 at CICR campus. “We have restricted mortality to 5% in kids and 1 % in adult goats which is next to CIRG (Central Institute of Research on Goats, Mathura, U.P.) and our goat farm ranks second in India as per the lowest mortality rate,” informs Mr. Shaikh. At present there are 500 goats in the farm spread in various locations. He adds,“Goats are separated to manage them well. A single farm of 50 goats is opened for visitors to show the management practices and quality of breeding goats.” Nearly 2000 goats are developed in the farm along with its associates of closely 5000 goats. Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Tamil Nadu and all major districts of Maharashtra are where the farm goats are sold. No transportation facility is provided to the buyers, and they have to make the arrangement on their own to carry the goats from the farm. Lot of inquiries are received from West Bengal, Delhi, Punjab and other North Indian states but transporting goats from Latur to buyer’s location is a challenging task. Demand of Osmanabadi goats from Gulf countries, Kenya, and Australia also goes unattended as shipping is a constraint. In India there are 23 registered goats breeds, and among these breed Osmanabadi goats have great demand for the meat in Gulf due to its palatability. Besides meat, this breed has high resistant power against diseases when vaccinated. It gets easily adapted to any state’s climatic conditions. The leather obtained from the skin of these goats after slaughtering is of superior quality which has a huge demand in the market. Osmanabdi goats get easily sold in any Indian market as the prices of these goats are not too high when compared to other goat breeds. Indian goat industry is meat oriented and not milk, whereas foreign countries are dependent on both. Any Indian goat breed gives hardly 1-4 liters milk/day, whereas foreign breeds give 15-20 liters of milk (toggen burg, saanen). The milk obtained from Indian goats is required for its kids to increase the weight. Hence no goat milk is left for any further processing as done in foreign countries. Fodders fed to goat vary from one breed to another. Osmanabadi goat breed requires more amount of green fodder and some concentrated fodder, whereas sirohi and jamnapari require more amount of dry fodder and less green fodder. “Generally people provide the same fodder to all types of goat breeds. Thus the desired results are not achieved. The ideal feed includes 60% of green fodder with different types of feed which further include dicots and monocot plants and grasses,” shares Mr. Shaikh. In time to come, Mr. Moshin Shaikh plans to open a goat farming hub at national level by uniting goat farmers from all Indian states to conduct goat expos for sharing updated information and knowledge on goat farming. He holds a degree in Alternative Medicine from Indian Board of Alternative Medicine, Calcutta and has 12 years’ experience in goat farming.
