It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to its left. It is the second most populous state in India after the state of Uttar Pradesh. Moreover, it ranks third in India among all the states when it comes to area covered. Maharashtra is also among the wealthiest states in the country. Its share of India's GDP is 14.95% making it one of the richest states in India. The Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra is the lower house of the bicameral legislature. Presently, the election is done directly by electing 288 members of the Legislative Assembly from the single-seat constituencies and one member is nominated. Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha constituencies The number of constituencies in 1960 in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha was 264. Out of which 33 constituencies were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled castes and 14 were reserved for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled tribes. However, in the third Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha (1967-72), the total number of constituencies was increased by 6 to 270. According to the new arrangement, 15 constituencies were reserved for the candidates belonging to the scheduled castes and 16 were reserved for the candidates belonging to the scheduled tribes. Currently, out of the 288 constituencies, 29 constituencies are reserved for the candidates belonging to the scheduled castes and 25 are reserved for the candidates belonging to the scheduled tribes. Election background Previously in 2009, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections the Democratic Front, which is the coalition of Congress (INC) and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), contested the elections against the union of Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and also against the third party called the Republican Left Democratic Front, popularly known as RIDALOS. The Democratic Front emerged victorious after bagging 82 seats by INC and 62 seats by NCP. Ashok Chavan became the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. However, he was replaced by Prithviraj Chavan post the Adarsh scam. Election Commission of Maharashtra The State Election Commission of Maharashtra had been established in the year 1994, according to the provisions of Article 243 K & 243 ZA of the Constitution of India. These provisions are responsible for conducting all the rural and urban local body's elections. In the coming elections 7.92 crore voters are expected to feature on the voter's list. This humungous increase in potential voters can be attributed to the fact that youngsters have been made aware of their duty to take part in democracy after intensive campaigning in the state. Major Political Parties and their strategies Different parties are putting forward different strategies for winning the elections. Prithviraj Chavan has said that Maharashtra will be having a Lokayukta in place very soon. He has said that the Maharashtra state government will be taking all the necessary steps that are mandatory to be taken for fulfilling Rahul Gandhi's directive on establishing a framework which would be helpful to tackle corruption. However, Prithviraj Chavan didn't mention the Adarsh case when he made the Lokayukta announcement at a public meeting which had been organised to celebrate the party's 128th foundation day at Congress Bhavan. BJP, on the other hand, had attacked Congress on the ground that the current Chief Minister was very slow when it comes to decision making. They feel that the state needs some quick action which would yield better results. RSS and BJP have collectively decided to hand over the main duties of the 2014 state assembly elections to the deputy leader of the Lok Sabha, Gopinath Munde. The top leadership of the party has felt that those differences between BJP President Nitin Gadkari and Munde can be taken care of only when their individual work will be different. In order to control the political conflict in Maharashtra, it has been decided that Gadkari is more likely to play a major role in Delhi, whereas, Munde would take care of Maharashtra. It's high time for BJP to prove their mettle in the state of Maharashtra.   List of the Assembly Constituencies in Maharashtra   Constituency No. Constituency Name Constituency No. Constituency Name 1 Akkalkuwa (ST) 145 Mira Bhayandar 2 Shahada (ST) 146 Ovala - Majiwada 3 Nandurbar (ST) 147 Kopri Pachpakhadi 4 Nawapur (ST) 148 Thane 5 Sakri (ST) 149 Mumbra Kalwa 6 Dhule Rural 150 Airoli 7 Dhule City 151 Belapur 8 Sindkheda 152 Borivali 9 Shirpur (ST) 153 Dahisar 10 Chopda (ST) 154 Magathane 11 Raver 155 Mulund 12 Bhusawal 156 Vikhroli 13 Jalgaon City 157 Bhandup West 14 Jalgaon Rural 158 Jogeshwari East 15 Amalner 159 Dindoshi 16 Erandol 160 Kandivali East 17 Chalisgaon 161 Charkop 18 Pachora 162 Malad West 19 Jamner 163 Goregaon 20 Muktainagar 164 Versova 21 Malkapur 165 Andheri West 22 Buldhana 166 Andheri East 23 Chikhli 167 Vile Parle 24 Sindkhed Raja 168 Chandivali 25 Mehkar (SC) 169 Ghatkopar West 26 Khamgaon 170 Ghatkopar East 27 Jalgaon Jamod 171 Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar 28 Akot 172 Anushakti Nagar 29 Balapur 173 Chembur 30 Akola West 174 Kurla (SC) 31 Akola East 175 Kalina 32 Murtijapur (SC) 176 Vandre East 33 Risod 177 Vandre West 34 Washim (SC) 178 Dharavi (SC) 35 Karanja 179 Sion Koliwada 36 Dhamangaon Railway 180 Wadala 37 Badnera 181 Mahim 38 Amravati 182 Worli 39 Teosa 183 Shivadi 40 Daryapur (SC) 184 Byculla 41 Melghat (ST) 185 Malabar Hill 42 Achalpur 186 Mumbadevi 43 Morshi 187 Colaba 44 Arvi 188 Panvel 45 Deoli 189 Karjat 46 Hinganghat 190 Uran 47 Wardha 191 Pen 48 Katol 192 Alibag 49 Savner 193 Shrivardhan 50 Hingna 194 Mahad 51 Umred (SC) 195 Junnar 52 Nagpur South West 196 Ambegaon 53 Nagpur South 197 Khed Alandi 54 Nagpur East 198 Shirur 55 Nagpur Central 199 Daund 56 Nagpur West 200 Indapur 57 Nagpur North (SC) 201 Baramati 58 Kamthi 202 Purandar 59 Ramtek 203 Bhor 60 Tumsar 204 Maval 61 Bhandara (SC) 205 Chinchwad 62 Sakoli 206 Pimpri (SC) 63 Arjuni Morgaon (SC) 207 Bhosari 64 Tirora 208 Vadgaon Sheri 65 Gondia 209 Shivajinagar 66 Amgaon (ST) 210 Kothrud 67 Armori (ST) 211 Khadakwasla 68 Gadchiroli (ST) 212 Parvati 69 Aheri (ST) 213 Hadapsar 70 Rajura 214 Pune Cantonment 71 Chandrapur (SC) 215 Kasba Peth 72 Ballarpur 216 Akole (ST) 73 Brahmapuri 217 Sangamner 74 Chimur 218 Shirdi 75 Warora 219 Kopargaon 76 Wani 220 Shrirampur (SC) 77 Ralegaon (ST) 221 Nevasa 78 Yavatmal 222 Shevgaon 79 Digras 223 Rahuri 80 Arni (ST) 224 Parner 81 Pusad 225 Ahmednagar City 82 Umarkhed (SC) 226 Shrigonda 83 Kinwat 227 Karjat Jamkhed 84 Hadgaon 228 Georai 85 Bhokar 229 Majalgaon 86 Nanded North 230 Beed 87 Nanded South 231 Ashti 88 Loha 232 Kaij (SC) 89 Naigaon 233 Parli 90 Deglur (SC) 234 Latur Rural 91 Mukhed 235 Latur City 92 Basmath 236 Ahmadpur 93 Kalamnuri 237 Udgir (SC) 94 Hingoli 238 Nilanga 95 Jintur 239 Ausa 96 Parbhani 240 Umarga (SC) 97 Gangakhed 241 Tuljapur 98 Pathri 242 Osmanabad 99 Partur 243 Paranda 100 Ghansawangi 244 Karmala 101 Jalna 245 Madha 102 Badnapur (SC) 246 Barshi 103 Bhokardan 247 Mohol (SC) 104 Sillod 248 Solapur City North 105 Kannad 249 Solapur City Central 106 Phulambri 250 Akkalkot 107 Aurangabad Central 251 Solapur South 108 Aurangabad West (SC) 252 Pandharpur 109 Aurangabad East 253 Sangole 110 Paithan 254 Malshiras (SC) 111 Gangapur 255 Phaltan (SC) 112 Vaijapur 256 Wai 113 Nandgaon 257 Koregaon 114 Malegaon Central 258 Man 115 Malegaon Outer 259 Karad North 116 Baglan (ST) 260 Karad South 117 Kalwan (ST) 261 Patan 118 Chandwad 262 Satara 119 Yevla 263 Dapoli 120 Sinnar 264 Guhagar 121 Niphad 265 Chiplun 122 Dindori (ST) 266 Ratnagiri 123 Nashik East 267 Rajapur 124 Nashik Central 268 Kankavli 125 Nashik West 269 Kudal 126 Deolali (SC) 270 Sawantwadi 127 Igatpuri (ST) 271 Chandgad 128 Dahanu (ST) 272 Radhanagari 129 Vikramgad (ST) 273 Kagal 130 Palghar (ST) 274 Kolhapur South 131 Boisar (ST) 275 Karvir 132 Nalasopara 276 Kolhapur North 133 Vasai 277 Shahuwadi 134 Bhiwandi Rural (ST) 278 Hatkanangle (SC) 135 Shahapur (ST) 279 Ichalkaranji 136 Bhiwandi West 280 Shirol 137 Bhiwandi East 281 Miraj (SC) 138 Kalyan West 282 Sangli 139 Murbad 283 Islampur 140 Ambernath (SC) 284 Shirala 141 Ulhasnagar 285 Palus-Kadegaon 142 Kalyan East 286 Khanapur 143 Dombivali 287 Tasgaon - Kavathe Mahankal 144 Kalyan Rural 288 Jat Last Updated on : October 13, 2014 Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2014 Maharashtra Election Results Maharashtra Parliamentary Constituencies Assembly Election Results Andhra Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Haryana Maharashtra Odisha Sikkim India Assembly Elections 2014 Maharashtra Assembly Elections Arunachal Pradesh Assembly    Elections Odisha Assembly Elections Andhra Pradesh Assembly    Elections Haryana Assembly Elections Telangana Assembly Elections     Buy this Map               About India Flag of India
