Now since the last 2 years, I work as internal auditor of ISO for 17 farmers who are mainly into exporting their products in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra,”  shares Mr. Naik. ISO is involved with farmers at grass root level for development of quality. ISO gives farmers their process study in cultivation and money for their work for continual development as per quality that meets customer expectations. Providing more insight on ISO certification, Mr. Naik says one should first make a quality manual. The quality manual contains complete process of work including micro and follow-up process. After internal audit comes the application for accreditation. A certificate of 3 years is given after the external audit. An ISO certification defines the process and gives exact result records at every stage. This procedure improves productivity of farming, net profit and customer satisfaction. Besides, an ISO certification is mandatory for export in certain countries. “Experience in internal audit, fees, and which accreditation body farmer selects should be considered while selecting the ISO consultant,” says Mr. Naik on selection of an ISO consultant as he signs off.
