It is the most prominent ‘giant’ bamboo that has naturalized to local climate. The clumping bamboos, such as those in the Bambusa genus, create new plants by growing new shoots very near the base of existing plants, as opposed to the “running” types like those found in the Phyllostachys family which can often send “runners” or rhizomes out several meters before sprouting a new shoot. This makes the clumping variety become denser over time, as it doesn’t spread out very much. While the running types are generally considered invasive and difficult to confine and maintain, the clumping types like Bambusa balcooa require very little effort to contain to a specific area. It can grow up to a height of 25 m, and a thickness of 15 cm SPECIAL FEATURES: The height of the bamboo will be 12 – 22 m; Diameter – 6 – 15 cm; Leaves are narrow and are on average 15-30 cm long and 25-50 mm broad.
