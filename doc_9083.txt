The crises have arisen due to various reasons including government apathy, lack of awareness, natural calamities etc. As far as organic farming is concerned, it should be promoted more, as not only is it more cost-effective but also good for retaining the health of soil over the long-term. Excess use of fertilizers may show short-term results, but will definitely have adverse effects in the long run, not only affecting the farm in question, but also the environment overall. As far as coming into the mainstream industrialists, is concerned, agriculture itself is a huge industry in our country. We are basically an agrarian country. There is tremendous potential for farming in our country, as feeding such a large population like ours is not an easy task. Importing food stuffs also cannot be an answer. Hence, with the use of modern techniques, right knowledge and favorable support from the government, farmers themselves can successfully be the proverbial "industrialists".

Durga Prasad Rao, Proprietor and Farmer, Sai Durga Overseas says- Yes It’s true that farmers are struggling for their crop’s market many times. Sometimes they didn’t get actual value price for their crops. To be an organic farmer I can say that organic farming always has demands. So, genuine organic farmer never starves but it has to be in the genuine. Rather a unique system has to be formulated to motivate farmers to incline towards organic farming and support the community by establishing value addition facility to the organic produces. A market support base programmer has to be devised with its extension. Sai Durga Overseas Flat No. 301-D, Navya Nulife Apartments, Dairy Hospital Road, Sheela Nagar, Visakhapatnam - 530012.

Goat farmers are never in crisis if they have personally handled their goat farms. The main reason behind this is the skyrocketing prices of goats and goat meat. Five years back the price of goat meat was Rs. 100 per kg and petrol was Rs. 40/liter and now the goat meat price is Rs. 400/kg and petrol is Rs. 80/liter. This shows that in the last few years the prices of goat meat have increased nearly thrice. So the goat farmers will have a golden era in next 30 years. Also the government should come forward to provide necessary help financially as well as technically to the goat farmers so that they can be on par in the mainstream as industrialists.

Indian farmers are facing crisis, not now but from decades. Some big potential Indian farmers have turned themselves as a direct exporters, means they harvest and they export it. But medium or small farmers can’t do it due to lack of knowledge or their own limitation. Government of India is taking steps to make Indian farmers secured and is trying to provide then a helping hand so that farmers can overcome the crisis. It will be not an instant solution but Yes one day with help of government, traders, distributors, wholesalers and every person/body who takes the benefit of products/crops supplied by farmers, when all these people comes together and make a WIN-WIN approach to each and every involved party (from farmer to end user) that time, things will be different. Things will be profitable for all. Gigantic Triumph Private Limited Nashik, Maharashtra, INDIA.

And the second reason is that a farmer should become professional because farming is not tradition now a days but it is a business. So if you take it as your business then I think the farmer should survive better.

But nowadays... many open markets came into existence and reasonably good price is getting for farmers.... If a small farmer trying to sell in a local market, he won't get even the half price at which the product is ultimately sold in the market... that is my experience too. In the local markets, organic products are not separately considered and the pricing is common. But in Cities and hypermarkets, we can see that the organic products has separate counters and the price is more than double. The local organic farmers are not getting the benefit of this to a large extent due to his limitations.

I personally think there should not be a discrimination based on the profits of an organic farmer or non-organic one. Rather a unique system has to be formulated to motivate farmers to incline towards organic farming and support the community by establishing value addition facility to the organic produces.

How can a farmer come out from this situation? Actually, all agro products go directly to the trader or commission agents.

Mainly this may be due to the over dependence on monsoons and lack of irrigation facilities in most parts. Maybe the interlinking of rivers will prove to offset these to a certain extent. But we are living a global village and the happenings thousands of kilometers away will affect our village too. International production trends and crops affect the prices of our local crops too. Therefore, this requires planning and preparedness at the highest level. Organic farmer may be protected as long as he is small or medium. But large scale will have to be within the gamut of the macro scenario. Farmer turning into Industrialist is rare. Mainly due to the skills required for both are different. Cultivation ad production calls for a totally different mindset. Toyo Biotech TOYO Adoor House, Thevally P.O.

Second most important is that farmer grows the produce but he is not in a position to dictate his selling price (MRP). The returns which he gets are dependent on the market. His days will be better when he sells his produce at a price he decides.
