Mr. Jose Thomas, Mr. Ramachandra Varier and Mr. Henshel Varghese are the promoters of the company. The company exports genuine herbs and spices from Kerala which are high in demand. Nutmeg, cardamom, pepper and a number of raw herbs are the other products that are exported. The annual turnover of the company is less than Rs. 5 Crores. The company exports 60 percent of its products, and the remaining are sold in the domestic market. Exports are made to UK, USA, Asian countries and Middle East. “Genuine products, supply before the date offered, and contracts through contact” are some features, Mr. Jose says, that set Agro Biotech apart from its competitors. “We have some monopoly products like medicated bed sheets, medicated agro bags, medicated pillow case, and solar equipment,” he further adds. Raw herbs are procured from tribal people who collect the same from the forests of Kerala. As for spices, the company has its own farms & plantations. It depends on contract farming for quality and quantity products. All products are acquired from the farmers directly with no involvement of traders in between. Irrespective of whether the farmer’s land is his own or taken on lease, any spice growing farmer who wishes to be associated with the company is given seedlings and manures. The farm’s activities are supervised by the company from planting, pre-harvesting and post harvesting, up to packing. The associated farmers are expected to work with the company for a minimum of 5 years. The company also provides additional incentives to farmers and employees according to the profit from each center. An ISO certified company, Agro Biotech has its own internal quality norms that vary from customer to customer. “Experienced professionals are our main pillars,” shares Mr. Jose. The company has qualified professionals in different fields. All employees are its shareholders. Agro Biotech aims to continue growing with each year of operation. It makes sure that its activities are diversified while also updating information and automating the agro field.
