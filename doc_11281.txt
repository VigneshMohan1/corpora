The farm machines manufactured by the company include threshers, multi-crop threshers, rotovators, tractor trailers, drip laying equipment, turmeric steamer and turmeric polisher. The high profile modern multi-crop thresher is the main product of the company. The paddy thresher was launched in 2000 and was an instant success. Customers came back asking for a multi-crop thresher instead of a single crop thresher and thus was born the idea of a multi-crop thresher. Valasumani also devised special hullers, peg tooths, blower fans, shaker assembly and sieves to suit the threshing operation of different crops and launched its first model multi-crop thresher during the year 2002. Valasumani’s paddy thresher is a patented machine by Government of India and its multi-crop thresher has its patent pending. Any farmer with over 5 acres of land is a target customer of the company. “As our product is a high profile machine, more farmers buy this machine and work on an Entrepreneur Model of Business to earn a standard living out of this machine. We participate in exhibitions & have dealer and sales representations to reach our customer prospects. We have a strong customer support team to handle any customer inquiry and pre-sales activity for order closures,” adds R. Ramalingam, Chief Executive. State Governments of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh extend subsidy to the company. Subsidy allotted for the multi-crop threshers is given by the Government of India. Further NABARD is also funding its product with 25% subsidy. The Company has managed to address all the manufacturing challenges it has come across. The company’s products come with a warranty of one year against any manufacturing defect. The company has trained service technicians to attend to any complaint or service requirement.
