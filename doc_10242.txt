Go to the shop A K Biotech – Spices and Spirulina Home A K Biotech – Spices and Spirulina Suppliers of spices and spirulina based products A K Biotech was started in 2011 in Dindigul, Tamilnadu. Mr. Karthik Kannan and Mr. Khan are the founders. The company’s products include spirulina soap, spirulina’s beauty care products, and spices like ginger, black pepper, turmeric and red chillis. Its sister company specializes in spices and tea. A K Biotech was started with the help of Sirpigal Trust, a trust that helps poor children with their studies. The turnover of the company is Rs. 50 lakhs. All spices are generated from Dindigul through local farmers. A team of 25 workers are also associated with the company. The products are sold to wholesale dealers and also to exporters when there is a demand. “We believe in quality and nature. Our aim is to sell quality products. As the market is tough we try to maintain our best quality for our customers,” says Mr. Karthik. However, there are still challenges that the company needs to handle. Prices of spirulina are never stable since a lot of new producers have emerged in the field. With each one having a price of his own, there is no constant price that can be fixed, thus making it difficult to have a strong foothold in the industry. The company is currently operating in Tamil Nadu, UP and certain areas in MP. Despite knowing the cons of dealing through middle men, the company continues to take their support. “Without their support we can’t sell our products. That is probably their intention,” shares Mr. Karthik. In the future, A K Biotech aims to supply more products to exporters. In the coming years, it plans on growing to bigger levels. Mr. Karthik Kannan holds M.Sc. in microbiology. He initially worked as a product manager in Chennai before establishing A K Biotech.
