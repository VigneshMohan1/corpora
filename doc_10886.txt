Go to the shop Reddy Farms – agriculture machinery Home Reddy Farms – agriculture machinery Designs and invents agriculture machinery for farm mechanization Reddy Farms located in Bangalore was founded by Mr. Gopal Reddy. The turnover of this farm amounts to Rs. 60 lakhs per year. The annual production of banana at Reddy farms is 1,70,000 kg Nendra, Turmeric 20000 kg, and coconut 1,20,000 units per year. Banana and coconuts are sold to the local merchants and turmeric at Erode market. Being a mechanical engineer and having worked for the dairy in the maintenance of machines, inventing new machines was not a tough task for Mr. Reddy. Reddy farms represents one of the faces of innovation and revolution in agriculture. With their invention of machines to mechanise farming, they have made life easier for various farmers. “We have developed Turmeric seeding and harvesting machines, and for banana we developed tractor-attached raised bed forming and attached the reciprocating pump of the discarded scooter we had in our farm for spraying purpose and we also developed the tractor-attached chaff cutter which can be used for multi-purposes like chopping maize, paddy straw for silage purpose, chopping coconut dry leaves for vermi compost purpose,” shares Mr. Reddy. Turmeric planting machine is a tractor attached with a loading bin capacity of 100 kg. This planting machine performs four operations at a time. The efficiency of this machine is such that it can plant 1 acre within 2- 2½ hours depending upon the loading time. Turmeric harvester is also a tractor-attached machine. It is designed according to the planting width so that it does not damage the rhizome. Both these products can be used for potatoes as well. Hitech Chaff cutter and tractor attached maize harvester are the other products invented by Reddy farms. “The cutting blades are made up of high carbon steel and have arrangement for self-sharpening of the blades. The chaff cutter is mounted on a solid structure with wheel, attached for easy movement. Tractor-attached maize harvester is the most advanced and it can operate by only tractor driver. This can cut the maize in the field itself, chaff and load to the tractor trailer at the same time,” Mr. Reddy explains. Apart from these machines, they have also developed drip pipe winding device. This device rolls the drip laterals once the crop is completed. It requires only two man power to roll the laterals laid to any extent of land. It’s very fast and neat bundling helps easy storage. Reddy farms are also planning to design and develop raised bed forming, drip lateral laying and mulching plastic sheet laying and forming using tractor. It has full-fledged work shop with all infrastructures for manufacturing all their machinery. They also sell products to the farmers directly. Their chaff cutters are exported through certain export agencies. Reddy Farms are now looking for dealers and distributors to market their products across India. In addition, they are working on receiving Government subsidy to be of better help to the farmers. They are open to ventures to produce these machines on large scale.
