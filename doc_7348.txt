The developments in the seed industry in India, particularly in the last 30 years, are very significant. A major re-structuring of the seed industry by Government of India through the National Seed Project Phase-I (1977-78), Phase-II (1978-79) and Phase-III (1990-1991), was carried out, which strengthened the seed infrastructure that was most needed and relevant around those times.  This could be termed as a first turning point in shaping of an organized seed industry. Introduction of New Seed Development Policy (1988 – 1989) was yet another significant mile stone in the Indian Seed Industry, which transformed the very character of the seed industry.  The policy gave access to Indian farmers of the best of seed and planting material available anywhere on the world.  The policy stimulated appreciable investments by private individuals, Indian Corporate and MNCs in the Indian seed sector with strong R&D base for product development in each of the seed companies with more emphasis on high value hybrids of cereals and vegetables and hi-tech products such as Bt. Cotton.  As a result, farmer has a wide product choice and seed industry today is set to work with a ‘farmer centric’ approach and is market driven.  However, there is an urgent need for the State Seed Corporations also to transform themselves in tune with the industry in terms of infrastructure , technologies, approach and the management culture to be able to survive in the competitive market and to enhance their contribution in the national endeavour of increasing food production to attain food & nutritional security.   Top 2.   Policy Initiatives in Seed Sector : The following policy initiatives have been taken by the Government of India in seed sector:-   •    Enactment of the Seeds Act, 1966 •    Seed Review Team-SRT (1968) •    National Commission on Agriculture’s Seed Group (1972) •    Launching of the World Bank aided National Seeds Programme (1975-85) in three phases     leading to the creation of State Seeds Corporations, State Seed Certification Agencies,     State Seed Testing Laboratories, Breeder Seed Programmes etc •    Seed Control Order (1983) •    Creation of the Technology Mission on Oilseeds & Pulses (TMOP)  in 1986 now called The     Integrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize (ISOPOM). •    Production and Distribution Subsidy •    Distribution of Seed Mini-kits •    Seed Transport Subsidy Scheme (1987) •    New Policy on Seed Development (1988) •    Seed Bank Scheme (2000) •    National Seeds Policy (2002) •    The Seeds Bill (2004) •    Formulation of National Seed Plan (2005) •    National Food Security Mission (2007) •    Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (2007)               National Seeds Policy, 2002: Thrust Areas      –        variety development –        plant variety protection –        seed production –        quality assurance –        seed distribution and marketing –        infrastructure facilities –        transgenic plant varieties –        import of seeds and planting materials –        seed exports –        promotion of domestic private sector seed industry –        strengthening of the  monitoring system          Seeds Bill, 2004: Salient Features   •      Registration of kinds and varieties of Seeds etc.      –    Evaluation of performance      –    Compensation to Framers      –    Registration of Seed Producers and Processing Units      –    Seed dealers to be Registered •     Regulation of Sale of Seed and Seed Certification •     Seed Analysis and Seed Testing •     Export and Import of Seeds and Planting Material •     Offences and Punishment. Top      3.   Seed Production System In India :                 The Indian seed programme largely adheres to the limited generations’ system for seed multiplication in a phased manner.  The system recognizes three generations namely breeder, foundation and certified seeds and provides adequate safeguards for quality assurance in the seed multiplication chain to maintain the purity of the variety as it flows from the breeder to the farmer.   Breeder Seed                Breeder seed is the progeny of nucleus seed of a variety and is produced by the originating breeder or by a sponsored breeder.  Breeder seed production is the mandate of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and is being undertaken with the help of;  i)          ICAR Research Institutions, National Research Centres and All India Coordinated Research Project of different crops; ii)         State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) with 14 centres established in different States; iii)         Sponsored breeders recognized by selected State Seed Corporations, and iv)        Non-Governmental Organizations.                ICAR also promotes sponsored breeder seed production programme through the National Seeds Corporation (NSC) / State Farms Corporation of India (SFCI), State Seeds Corporation (SSCs), Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) etc.                 There has been a steady increase in the production of breeder seed over the years.                 The indents from various seeds producing agencies are collected by the State Departments of Agriculture and submitted to the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC), Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, which is turn compiles the whole information crop wise and sends it to the Project Coordinator/Project Director of the respective crops in ICAR for final allocation of production responsibility to different SAUs/ICAR institutions.  The allocation of responsibility for production of breeder seed is discussed in the workshop in respect of the particular crop and is made to various centres as per the facilities and capabilities available at the centres and the availability of nucleus seed of a particular variety.  It may be noted that indents are compiled and forwarded to ICAR at least 18 months in advance. To make the programme systematic, and for proper evaluation of the breeder seed production programme, monitoring terms have been constituted and reporting proformae have been devised.  The monitoring terms consist of breeder of the variety, the concerned Project Director or his nominee, representative of NSC .  The production of breeder seed is reviewed every year by ICAR-DAC in the annual seed review meeting.                 The actual production of breeder seed by different centres is intimated to DAC by ICAR.  On receipt of information from ICAR, the available breeder seed is allocated to all the indenters in an equitable manner.  In the case of varieties which are relevant only to a particular State, the indents for breeder seed are placed by the concerned Director of Agriculture with the SAUs/ICAR institutions located in the State.  The breeder seed produced is lifted directly by the Director of Agriculture or foundation seed producing agencies authorized by him.   Foundation Seed               Foundation seed is the progeny of breeder seed and is required to be produced from breeder seed or from foundation seed which can be clearly traced to breeder seed.  The responsibility for production of foundation seed has been entrusted to the NSC, SFCI, State Seeds Corporation, State Departments of Agriculture and private seed producers, who have the necessary infrastructure facilities.  Foundation seed is required to meet the standards of seed certification prescribed in the Indian Minimum Seeds Certification Standards, both at the field and laboratory testing.   Certified Seed                Certified seed is the progeny of foundation seed and must meet the standards of seed certification prescribed in the Indian Minimum Seeds Certification Standards, 1988.  In case of self pollinated crops, certified seeds can also be produced from certified seeds provided it does not go beyond three generations from foundation seed stage-I.               The production and distribution of quality/certified seeds is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments.  Certified seed production is organized through State Seed Corporation, Departmental Agricultural Farms, Cooperatives etc. The distribution of seeds is undertaken through a number of channels i.e. departmental outlets at block and village level, cooperatives, outlets of seed corporations, private dealers etc.  The efforts of the State Governments are being supplemented by NSC and SFCI which produce varieties of national importance.  NSC markets its seeds through its own marketing network and also through its dealer network.  SFCI markets its seeds mainly through the State Departments of Agriculture and the State Seed Corporations.  The production of certified seed by NSC and State Seed Corporations is mainly organized through contract growing arrangements with progressive farmers. SFCI undertakes seed production on its own farms.  The private sector has also started to play an important role in the supply of quality seeds of vegetables and crops like hybrid maize, sorghum, Bajra, cotton, castor, sunflower, paddy etc.                  The requirement of certified/quality seeds is assessed by State Governments on the basis of the area sown under different crop varieties, area covered by hybrid and self-pollinated varieties as well as the seed replacement rate achieved.  The availability of seed is ascertained by the State Departments of Agriculture on the basis of the production of seed in government farms and production of seeds by State Seeds Corporations and other agencies.  The Government of India periodically assesses the requirement and availability of seeds through detailed interaction with State Governments and seed producing agencies in the bi-annual Zonal Seed Review Meetings and the National Kharif and Rabi Conferences.  The Department of Agriculture and Cooperation facilitates tie-up arrangements with seed producing agencies to ensure that the requirement of seeds is met to the maximum extent possible.                Information on Production and availability of Breeder, Foundation and Certified seeds can be accessed from this portal.     Production / Availability Of Certified/Quality Seed                                                                              Qty.
