The transmission systems in vehicles are installed to send signals from one part to another such as from engines to wheels to ensure mobility. In this process, several components that are fixed in the back of the engine in a car play integral part. There is limited variety we find in the transmission devices across the globe. However, some of the essential components of transmission system are modulator, torque converter, planetary gears, governor, computer, seals, output shafts, differential, hydraulic designs, axles an pressure plate. Types of Transmission System: The automobile transmission system can be classified into two types including manual transmission and automatic transmission. In case of the manual transmission system, the vehicle is driven with the assistance of gearshift and foot clutch. The other components, which are used in this process, are flywheel, pressure plate and ring gears. In case of the automatic transmission system, the gears are changed automatically corresponding with the vehicle's speed. The basic components essential for this process are modulator, torque converter, planetary gears, governor, computer, seals and hydraulic designs. Features of Transmission Systems: The manual as well as automatic transmission systems have their own advantages and disadvantages. To start with, the manual transmission system increases fuel efficiency of the vehicles. It is cost-effective in terms of maintenance. In this process, the driver has the optimum control over the vehicle. Automobiles enabled with manual transmission system can overtake other vehicles much easily as it comes with extra throttle valve. It allows driver to go for lower gear that makes the process more powerful. The automatic transmission systems remove the task of depressing clutch pedal and choosing a gear ratio. The process makes the task simple and easy. Unlike manual transmission, the auto transmission system has only two pedals instead of three. To select any mode, the diver needs to use a gear-shift lever fixed on the car floor. Here, the person needs to maneuver through shift lock buttons provided on the lever. In the vehicles enabled with automatic transmission system, you would find P for Park, R for Reverse, N for Neutral and D for Drive. On the selection of option P, the transmission system gets locked mechanically. The car stops to move. The Neutral option is selected to stop the wheels completely. If driver puts car on Neutral mode, one cannot start it. However, car can be shifted forth or back smoothly. Reverse mode helps the driver to drive in reverse direction. For this, the driver needs to push the shift lock button on the lever. Drive option allows the car to go in forward direction through various forward gears. Some of the cars in India, which have set the best examples of the automatic transmission system, are Skoda Superb, Toyota Camry and Honda CR-V. Nevertheless, both the systems have certain disadvantages also. In manual transmissions, the driver needs to be very careful and proficient. It loses to automatic transmission system in case of driving in the hilly regions. As per automatic transmission system is concerned, it does not allow optimum fuel efficiency.
