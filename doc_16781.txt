Recommendation /advice for adoption : Foliar application of plant growth regulator consortia (castor gold) 0.05 %( 0.5 ml/lit of water)at 25th and 60th days after sowing. Spraying should be done during morning or eveninghours. Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : More than 95% of pistillate flowers increase. 90% seed setting. Seed yield increases upto 29% Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Erode, Trichy and Perambalur districts.   Special Technology - 2 Seed priming with 1% kcl Name of the crop : Castor Name  of the management practice/Production/ Protectiontechnology of TNAU : Seed priming with 1% kcl for rainfed castor. Recommendation /advice for adoption : Seed priming with 1% KCI for 3 hours and sowing a week before onset of monsoon resulted in better seed yield in castor. Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : Seed priming increases germination percentage .It leads to maintain optimum plant population and drought tolerant. Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri, Erode, Perambalur and Trichy districts. Special Technology - 3 Management of Botryotinia grey model by chemical and bio agent Name of the crop : Castor Name  of the management practice/Production/ Protectiontechnology of TNAU : Management of Botryotinia grey model by chemical and bio agent Recommendation /advice for adoption : Foliar spray of Carbendazim 0.1% at 45and 60days is effective for the management of Botryotinia grey model Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : Foliar spray of Carbendazim 0.1% at 45and 60days interval recorded minimum grey mold incidence on primary and secondary spike respectively and recorded maximum seed yield. Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri, Erode, Perambalur and Trichy districts. Special Technology - 4 Name of the crop : Castor Name  of the management practice/Production/ Protectiontechnology of TNAU : Castor cultivation with Onion intercropping Recommendation /advice for adoption : Castor cultivation with Onion intercropping.In this intercropping system (Castor –Onion in 1:2 ratio.i.e.one row of castor +two rows of onion by adopting the spacing of 1.5m*1.0m for hybrid castor crop and adopting 60*30*60 cm Spacing i.e. leaving 60 cm either side of the castor crop by providing 30 cm spacing for onion crop.this system will be raised to getadditional productivity & profitability. Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : Suppress the weed growth at initial castor crop establishment stage there by harboring of pest and disease pathogens due to weed plants will be controlled .this will indirectly reduce the usage of herbicided and plant protection chemicals, creates safety environment.Besides one weeding cost will be reduced and farmers will get the high netreturns by rasing castor with onion intercropping. Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri, Erode, Perambalur and Trichy districts.     Special Technology - 5 Name of the crop : Tapioca Name  of the management practice/Production/ Protectiontechnology of TNAU : Tapioca sett treatment for scale insects Recommendation /advice for adoption : Dip the setts in Dimethoate @ 2ml/litre of the water +Carbendazim @ 2g/litre of water for 15 minutes before planting Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : Scale insects and mealy bug adhering to the planting material may be destroyed due to sett treatment Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : All zones of Tamilnadu All zones of Tamilnadu Special Technology - 6 Name of the crop : Tapioca Name  of the management practice/Production/ Protectiontechnology of TNAU : Management of micro nutrient deficieny Recommendation /advice for adoption : Foliar spray of 1%FeSO4+0.5%ZnSO4 at 60 and90 days after planting Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : Micro nutrient deficiency can be alleviated and yield loss can be avoided Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : All zones of Tamilnadu All zones of Tamilnadu Special Technology - 7 Name of the crop : Tapioca Name  of the management practice/Production/ Protectiontechnology of TNAU : Management of papaya mealy bug infestation in tapioca (Acerophagus Recommendation /advice for adoption : Release of mealy bug parasitioid papaya)@100Nos/acre Benefits expected due to adoption of this technology : Papaya mealy bug infestation in tapioca can be completely controlled and yield loss can beavoided Suitability of the location (a)Zone (b)Districts : All zones of Tamilnadu All zones of Tamilnadu For further information contact Dr. S.
