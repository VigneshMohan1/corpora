CENTRAL HERD REGISTRATION SCHEME CENTRAL HERD REGISTRATION SCHEME The Central Herd Registration Scheme is continuing with four Units located at Rohtak (Haryana), Ajmer (Rajasthan), Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and Ongole (Andhra Pradesh). These four units together cover the States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The cattle breeds of Hariana, Gir, Kankrej and Ongole and buffalo breeds of Murrah, Surti, Mehsana and Jaffrabadi are registered under the Scheme depending on the confirmation to breed characteristics and prescribed milk production norm. Owners of registered animals are provided certificate and prizes/incentives to encourage conservation of indigenous breeds and production of high quality cows and buffaloes. The Scheme has following major objectives:- i. To survey and study production records of cows and buffaloes in their breeding tracts. ii. Cataloguing of superior germplasm of the selected breeds in their breeding tracts as well as breeding farms through milk recording and registration. iii. To disseminate information on registered animals for sourcing of breeding material and inter-farm and inter-breeder exchange of animals. iv. To promote conservation of selected indigenous breeds by providing incentives to breeders. v. To regulate sale/purchase of elite animals to ensure and enforce quality control for further propagation of breeding. vi. To propagate and awaken consciousness amongst the breeders to improve their economics through livestock improvement by constant publicity, incentive and formation of breeder associations.
