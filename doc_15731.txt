It is believed that the temple is built on the spot where Ramayana was written by Valmiki. Local people say that this is also the same place where Ram and Sita's twin sons were born. The Ram Tirath Temple is considered as one the most sacred spots for the Hindus. The temple has statues depicting important scenes from the epic - Ramayana. According to the mythological beliefs, Lord Rama left her wife Sita in this very place where the temple stands now. It is believed that Valmiki - the great sage rescued her and gave her shelter. Sita gave birth to her sons - Luv and Kush and they grew up in the guidance of saint Valmiki. The Ram Tirath Temple can be easily counted among the prime Amritsar Tourist Attractions. A journey of only eleven Kilometers from Amritsar will take you to the wonderful site. Apart from the beautifully sculptured temple, the tank in front of the temple is another attraction for the pilgrims. A dip in the crystal clear tank is considered very pious and holy.
