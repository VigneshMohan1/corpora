Ltd says- In the name of green revolution, all the farmers are diverted from their traditional practices organic farming. Their input costs are high and the revenue is less in this method over a period of time. For two generations it is like this and all the farming lands are polluted and impotent. Now again they have been advised to go for organic farming. How can they go immediately . Does any small farmer have money and patience to wait for 4/5 years to go into organic farming. Your question is having the answer –Industrialist are doing organic farming , because they have money and man power. A C V Products Pvt.

Big shots are doing organic cultivation. They are not looking at the instant results and they are ready to wait but the common farmer needs to get the profit from his farm to survive. Labor shortage is a huge problem in agriculture and our administrators also neglect our basic food producing people and our farmers are also looking to the high life styles. They are teaching their kids that this is not a fine way to live and to go for other fields. So the new generation is not interested in agriculture as ancient technologies are used in India. We are not ready to adopt bio technology and other inventions.

I personally think there should not be a discrimination based on the profits of an organic farmer or non-organic one. Rather a unique system has to be formulated to motivate farmers to incline towards organic farming and support the community by establishing value addition facility to the organic produces. A market support base programmer has to be devised with its extension. Biocare India Shewalkar Garden, E wing Block 57/ A In front of VNIT Gate, Gopal Nagar Nagpur- 440022.

V Thomas, CEO Vanilla India Producer Company Ltd says- Yes, farmers are always in crisis. The only remedy is the value addition of their produce but farmers are not equipped with technical know-how for that. Producers, Co -operatives and companies have great role. Organic farming is a good concept but organic farming in small area means it is not purely organic as the surrounding area is cultivating with chemical fertilizers. Organically produced crops have a premium price and a premium class of people only consumes the same as they are health conscious.

LTA Trading Private Limited says - Farmers are in crisis because they are made dependable to external forces for their farming requirement. In case of natural farming, the farmer is self dependent and he no need to be in crisis. Because the cost is very less, yield is more and the price for organic product is in premium. We require the Government focus more in this area; LTA Trading Private Limited No. 51/7/1, Chitrakoot, Ratna Avenue, Richmond Road, Bangalore 560 025 Mobile: +91 9945066699 Reply With Quote June 26th, 2014 #27 editorialteam Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 1,063 Mr. Pramod Kumar Rathod, Co-Founder, Tradedoot.com says- In order to get purchase orders from bigwigs, organic farmers mandatorily have to get their soil, water and other inputs tested by laboratories, which are cost prohibitive and since the input costs for organic production are costlier and the farming is labour intensive cost of cultivation escalates. And since customers hardly differentiate the quality of organic products with inorganic they are not ready to pay premium prices to farmers thus farmer is left with low profit margin. Because of this farmer will never turn out to be an entrepreneur.

Farmers dont not crisis / risk management , how to get subsidy , as per the soil and environment condition which are the best crops and equipment , from where they can get bank loans and storage and handling is a big problem . So govt should start agri education programme at village level . Take an example of farmers from Kerla or karnataka , they produce spices and fruits rice and some of them are good exports also.

A genuine organic farmer came from swayampurn gram sanskruti. So, for them they are the best & unknown to us as industrialist. But the false demands and supply chain put them in crisis and struggle Shripad Consultancy D 171/172, Hanuman Nagar, Panchvati, Nashik -422003 Mob: 9404517494 Email: shripadconsultancy@gmail.com Reply With Quote June 30th, 2014 #30 editorialteam Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 1,063 Mr. Gautam Kar, Proprietor, Emerald Farm says- The statement is largely true. The nexus between application of commercial chemical fertilizers and incidence of pests and also of various vector and non- vector borne plant diseases have been conclusively proved. The phenomenon of pests building up genetic resistance to a particular molecule of pesticide when used repeatedly has also been conclusively proved. So in a farming model involving the use of chemical fertilizers and concomitant use of pesticides, the farmer has to constantly look for newer and more costly brand of pesticides and fungicides. The risk factors involved in chemical based farming is far higher and the farmer is always on tenterhooks – whether his crop will survive the next incidence of pest or disease. So such farmers are always in crisis. Despite seeing several instances of failure, aggressive marketing techniques of seed and pesticide manufacturing companies, ensure that farmers go in for their products in the hope of a better luck tomorrow. Organic farming which involves saving of seed from the previous crop which has fully adapted itself to local conditions, use of farm based inputs and largely own labour is a time tested process. The farmer has neither to borrow money to purchase seed nor of fertilizer nor for pesticide. His needs are less: his output may also be less, but at end of the day he is not in penury. He cannot come to the mainstream as an industrial agriculturist because industrial output by its very concept involves expediting of production through mechanization and expenditure of massive amounts of energy. This is contrary to the whole philosophy and ethos of organic farming.
