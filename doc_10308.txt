Singh The agri commodity business is a vastly under-estimated market in India with several areas that need serious attention and action. Mr. Chandra P. Singh, a B.Sc Agri, is one such person that hopes to make changes in this industry for the betterment of Indian agriculture. Mr. Singh works with DSCL, a commodity business established in 2007. The company is based in New Delhi with a team of over sixty professionals. As a synergistic business to Hariyali, the rural retail business of DSCL, the business was envisaged as a model for better farmer buying. Products DSCL offers various products to the market with particular success in their sugar and fertilizer, called Shriram business. Mr. Singh said, “Hariyali commands immense brand equity in areas of its presence and has over a million farmers as its customers.” Hariyali also offers training to farmers in Western Uttar Pradesh to help attain a sustainable supply of high quality sugarcane. “[The training] involves better crop husbandry training, with a team of agronomists who, not just monitor the progress, but also trouble shoot the farmers’ problems on a day-to-day basis,” Mr. Singh shared. Further Services Hariyali has initiated several efforts such as sourcing their goods from manufacturers that assure quality and having an agronomist at each outlet to visit and train farmers. Communication is the key point of exchange between the agronomist and farmers to overcome problems in the agricultural sector. Mr. Singh expounded, “This not just educates the farmers but also leads to better farm practices. We strive to build better know how and capability on product sales and risk management to aid farmers’ decision making processes when selling his produce.” SRR in India The Indian government has recently imposed a new SRR (seed replacement rate) target of 40%. Mr. Singh views the adoption of hybrids to be a crucial part of increasing SRR in India. He uses the example of corn to support his case saying, “Hybrid corn yields have gone up from 1.2-1.5 Mts/hac to 4-6 Mts/hac.” “SRR’s in India have been very low, especially in the case of grains (10% – 30% rate). Hybrids have done extremely well in the case of corn, sorghum and even pearl millet. How this gets broad-based to soybean, wheat and rice is crucial. If the corn model can be replicated with the government’s intervention this can go a long way,” he said. According to Mr. Singh, technology is also essential. “There is a need for better research infrastructure, and more importantly, better IP protection for companies to bring out their research for commercial distribution.” Future Plans Although India had success in the green revolution, Mr. Singh feels that the follow through of the revolution somewhat lacked luster. He attributed various opinions to this such as the lack of research and development from public and private enterprises, lack of focus on mechanization of production, and the access of farmers to credit flow. “We need to make bold steps,” Mr. Singh said. For now, though, the company plans on selective expansion and consolidation in existing sites to further the success of Hariyali. In terms of hiring more professionals for the company, Mr. Singh shared, “We look [for people with a] keen interest in farm and rural sectors, and humility and communication skills to interact with farmers.” Our Correspondent For more information, contact  : Mr.Chandra P Singh, BU Head – Commodities.
