With limited resources advisors struggle to reach the millions of farmers . Across countries, research institutes, universities, NGOs, extension services, companies, radio stations and farmer-based organisations are going to considerable efforts to find or develop suitable training materials for their staff and the farmers with whom they work. An on-line survey in 2011, organised by The Global Forum for Rural Advisory Services (GFRAS), the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), indicated that farmers mainly rely on outside agencies for watching agricultural training videos. Farmers would watch videos on their own with their family or neighbours if video disc distribution mechanisms were in place - and farmers are willing to pay for video discs and video shows if they felt it would benefit their business . About 85% of the more than 500 respondents found local languages very important for farmer training videos. To ensure that videos are sharable and of use to the global community of extension service providers and farmers, producing many poor quality local language videos is not cost-effective. Organisations are willing to translate and use videos made in other countries if they are relevant and of good quality, and if video scripts are available . Therefore, the establishment of an authoritative organisation that supports the on-line viewing, downloading and physical distribution of quality agricultural training videos will answer a real demand.
