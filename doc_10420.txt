Based at Bangalore, Karnataka Klink Bio Organic Fertilizers was established in 1998 at Bangalore. The company produces bio-organic fertilizers and pesticides. The turnover earned is more than Rs. 15 lakhs. It was founded by Mr. Nambiar Nair. The company’s bio chemicals show best results on crops like pepper, turmeric, ginger, paddy, sugar cane, coconut, ground nut, brinjal and major vegetables. These biochemicals turn leaves greener and flowers bigger. It also helps in more yield with better quality. Products are personally handed to the farmers after providing detailed information on its usage. “Most farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu prefer organic over chemical fertilizers,” says Mr. Arun Kummar, Organic Farming Consultant. “Organic fertilizers are available in limited shops. To increase the yield they offer organic zymes,” he further adds. Klink Bio Organic Fertilizers facilitates organic farming through K Zyme. Based on the crops the Zyme is classified in variants such as Zyme Vegetables, Zymes Flowers, Zyme Paddy, Zyme Chilly, K Zyme Wheat, and K Zyme Banana as growth promoter. Organic farming farmers get their yield on a slow and steady basis. Vegetables and fruits grown through organic farming have export quality, whereas chemical fruits or vegetables will be small and have some sort of chemical-based smell. The yield will also be low. Farmers can use mulching sheets, shade net, poly house, drip irrigation and sprinklers, and avoid chemical based fertilizers as much as they can to follow best farming practices. Company currently operates in Karnataka and southern parts of Tamil Nadu. Most clients approach them after having seen advertisements on internet. Some clients are made through reference, Agricultureinformation.com, Kisan Forum and Farmnest. “Our products are more affordable than the chemical fertilizers. We are also into direct service, we supply our products directly at farmer’s farm. During the spray of our fertilizer we spend time to teach them how to use the fertilizers” adds Mr. Kummar. Klink Bio Organic Fertilizers wishes to expand their organic fertilizers and organic farming to major parts of South Tamil Nadu and some parts of Karnataka. They plan to teach farmers about organic farming. Our Correspondent Contact details : Klink Bio Organic Fertilizers, SAP Marketing, No 21, 8th Cross, Cubbonpet, Bangalore 560002.
