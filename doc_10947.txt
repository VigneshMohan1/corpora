Your shopping bag is empty. Go to the shop Subarnrekha Marketing Home Subarnrekha Marketing Offers free consultancy to farmers. Deals in medicinal plants. Based at Jaleswar, Odisha Santanu Kumar Patra Subarnrekha Marketing established in 1997 by Mr. Santanu Kumar Patra. It is now re-named as Subarnarekha Agro Services. The poor infrastructure available to the farmers and their poverty were the driving force for opening the company where free consultancy is given to the farmers by approaching them directly for all their farming activities. The company does the business directly from the farmers to the companies and shares a percentage of the profit. Products and Services : Company deals in medicinal herbs like Bacoppa monnieri, Centella asiatica, Nuxvomica seeds, Indrajav and Sarpagandha. In aromatic plants category they offer only Nagarmotha only. The other operations are seed production, oil seeds, pulses, and vegetables. Mr. Patra inform, “we procure Nuxvomica seeds and Indrajab seeds from poor tribal collectors and sometimes through forest department/NGOs/SHGs and even directly from the collectors. We cultivate Sarpagandha. Bacoppa monnieri, Centella asiatica & Nagarmotha are cultivated by some farmers. We cultivate Acorus calamus, Bacoppa, Centella, Nagarmotha etc on contract farming basis.” He further adds, “we give free consultancy to farmers.  We visit farmers’ fields to solve their pest & other agricultural problems. We have at least 10,000 farmers who are directly linked with us.” Sales and Promotion : Online searches, surveys, and personal contacts with companies and farmers are the means of promoting the products and services. The company is willing to reduce the profit margin to get best quality and give best services but insists on immediate payments from the buyers and only with those who agree to the terms and conditions, the company does sales transactions. Similarly, it pays to farmers immediately after taking the stocks from their farm. Advice : Nuxvomica seeds are very much in demand in Homoeopathy, Veterinary and Ayurveda. Indrajab seeds are mostly used in Ayurvedia formulations. Mr. Patra maintain, “due to the change in lifestyle, people are inclined towards Ayurveda products and so the demand for the medicinal plants and the price are shooting up, which is a very encouraging trend.” He concludes saying, “market condition for medicinal plants in India is dominated by big companies in big cities who are not always committed to their words. Hence, we advise farmers to cultivate vegetables, pulse, seeds, and oil seeds which have an ever-green local market along with some medicinal plants.” Mr. Patra is an M.Sc in Agriculture from Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology. He has worked in Nath Seeds, Mahyco Seeds, State Medicinal Plant Board and done a project of UNDP on organic farming.
