The urge to provide the best of what nature has to offer is the driving force of this company. Having realized the potential of Indian Market for a variety of fruits and vegetables, Mrs. Neha Modi and Mr. Ashish Modi founded the company. “Grown by Nature” tagline of the company stands true to its chemical free production. The annual production of the company is 180 tons and the turnover is 27 million rupees.  Tech Organea grows four different mushroom varieties i.e., rose oysters, pearl oysters, sajor caju and dry mushrooms. “The markets in India are very fresh. The main variety prevailing are the Button Mushrooms. There is a huge market for these varieties,” says Mr. Ashish Modi, managing director of the company. The company retails as well as sells their products to hotels that believe in buying quality products. Pearl Oysters and Rose Oysters are in demand in the retail market while Sajor Caju and dry mushrooms are favored by restaurants. Their supply radius extends to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Main produce of the company is supplied to Kerala. Mr. Modi admits Mushroom farming has to be carefully done since mushrooms are very delicate in nature. “There is a lot of demand but very few suppliers” he adds. Mushrooms need to be cut at the right time maintaining the right balance between too matured and too young. Right moisture and storage are other essential aspects. Since the shelf life of packed mushrooms is 7 to 10 days, maintaining the right temperature is an important aspect as well. Mr. Modi shares that people hesitate to try a new and better product as they tend to stick to the ones they have already tried. Tech Organea has moved a step ahead in their marketing techniques by providing mushroom recipes in their website. “Ours is a specialty variety of mushrooms and not everyone is aware of the amazing ways in which it can be cooked.  Many consumers visit our website for reference,” says Mr. Modi speaking about this innovative step. Mr. Modi owes the success of the company to his wife for having been his inspiration. The company wishes to leave its footprints in the entire country in the coming years. They also plan to explore processed foods market.
