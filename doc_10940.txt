Go to the shop Sree Guruvayoorappan Dairy Farm and Vaikundam Farm Resorts Home Sree Guruvayoorappan Dairy Farm and Vaikundam Farm Resorts Bankruptcy, drought and umpteen losses could not deter to pursue dream to bring green and white revolution Sunil Kumar Sree Guruvayoorappan Dairy farm and Vaikundam Farm Resorts initially was established in 2011 in Tamil Nadu. However due to heavy drought, it was later shifted to Kerala, the bordering town of Marayur, where it is now situated. Mr. Sunil, who has been named the best dairy farmer in the taluk of Devikulam taluk is the proprietor of the farm. The total area of the farm is 15 acres. There are around 50 cattle and 33 calves. Breed and Yield : Sree Guruvayoorappan Dairy farm has both HF and Jersey breed. The current yield is 500 liters from 23 cows. For milking and cleaning, milking machines that enable milking of 10 cows at one time are used. All the feed provided to the cattle is made by Mr. Sunil himself by mixing almost 10 to 12 products. Some of these products include white and yellow maize, cotton seed, groundnut cake, gingily oil cake, coconut oil cake, soya, urad dal dust, wheat bran and dried tapioca’s flour. Health and hygiene : “Every day I personally follow up the results of feed considering milk yield and their physical behavior and if there is any difference I notice, I immediately check the temperature and consult Dr. Shaji, a very good veterinarian,” says Mr. Sunil. With ample help from government doctors the farm animals are free from diseases to a great extent. Tonics and mineral powders by Pfizer like capsola gold, vitamix and CRS powder are also fed to the animals. Mr. Sunil spends extra money to ensure the best of care to his cows. Customers : Apcos – Amul patent milk cooperative society is the major customer of the farm. The milk is supplied to Milma from Apcos. Road blocks : Mr. Sunil’s journey in the field has not been very pleasant owing to a lot of challenges faced, both natural and man-made. The climate in Marayur is extremely cold, and the shift from a hot weathered place to a cold one, brought down the milk level to a considerable extent. It has however been picking up of late. The drought in Tamil Nadu left Mr. Sunil with a loss of Rs. 1.3 crores. Unable to pay back the loan that he took from Indian Overseas Bank, Karuvannur, he is now forced to sell his 22 acre land in Tamil Nadu. His loan applications are often rejected by several banks. Despite the urge and the passion to make a positive change, farmers like Mr. Sunil are often tied down by the rules of the land and lack of help and finances. Basic amenity like electricity is also not available in the area where the farm is set up, limiting the vast potential that the farm and the proprietor hold. To make a way out of these road blocks, when Mr. Sunil tried finding a way out by wishing to develop a tourism project, banks failed him again. Future plans : The farm aims to increase its yield from 500 liters a day to 1000. Mr. Sunil wishes to develop eco-friendly tourism in his farm to create green and white revolution together. The hands driving the farm : Mr. Sunil holds an M.A in English and DMMBA. He invested all his money in developing agriculture, but tough times led him to bankruptcy. However he has not yet given up hope in developing his business. His passion for agriculture and belief in God keep him motivated. He signs off saying, “Please fight for farmers. Jai Kisan Jai India.” Our Correspondent Contact information : Sree Guruvayoorappan Dairy Farm and Vaikundam Farm Resorts, Souparnika, Karuvannur Thrissur, Kerala, India Mobile: 9447516969 Email: sunilmenon16@yahoo.co.in /sunilmenon16@gmail.com Source : Agriculture & Industry Survey Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 5+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Sree Guruvayoorappan Dairy Farm and Vaikundam Farm Resorts Related – articles, consultants, downloads Dairy Manager Demo JMD Farm – Exotic vegetables Green Farm Organic Darjeeling Gardens You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
