It provides employment to millions of people and contributes to food security of the country. With a coastline of over 8,000 km, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of over 2 million sq km, and with extensive freshwater resources, fisheries play a vital role. India ranks second in world fish production, contributing about 5.4 per cent of global fish production. It is also a major producer of f fish through aquaculture. Total fish production during 2013-14 is estimated at 9.45 mt with 6.10 mt coming from the inland sector and 3.35 mt from the marine sector. The sector contributes about 1 per cent to overall GDP and represents 4.6 per cent of agri GDP.

The production of fisheries (in 000’tonne) in major states is given below: Year Andhra Pradesh West Bengal Gujarat Kerala Tamilnadu 2012-13 1675.44 1490.01 848.79 677.78 620.40 The bulk of the marine catch comprises oil sardines, followed by penaeid and non-penaeid shrimp, Indian mackerel, Bombay duck, croakers, smaller quantities of cephalopods, other sardines and threadfin breams. The major species from inland capture includes cyprinids, siluroids and murrels. Vannamei shrimp, black tiger shrimp, cuttlefish, lobster, clams, fish fillets and squid are certain products that are exported from India. India’s substantial fishery resources are under-utilised and there is tremendous potential to increase the output. There is a huge scope for investments in packaged products, marine processing plants, operations in preservation, processing and export of coastal fish for the private sector as it holds vast, untapped marine resources with a great export potential. Processing of fish into canned and frozen forms is carried out mostly for exports. Besides, there is an increased demand for processed and ready-to-eat marine products in the domestic and foreign market. During 2013-14 exports aggregated to 9,83,756 MT valued at Rs. 30,213.26 crores and US$ 5,007.70 million.
