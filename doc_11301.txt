In the beginning he started with a few acres but today the farm has 10 acres of grapes, 5 acres of banana and 5 acres of sugarcane cultivation. His son, Mr. Pankaj Magdum follows his footsteps and proudly joins the agriculture industry. He helps in managing the farm and keeps Mr. Bharat well-informed about the new changes in agriculture. “We are growing Thompson variety of seedless grapes, G9 variety banana and sugarcane at our farm. We bought banana tissue culture plants and it is growing very well,” shares Mr. Pankaj. He further adds, “We are using both chemical and organic farming for cultivation. Bio-fertilizers are used for banana while chemical fertilizer is utilized for grapes. We get good yield of all the crops.” Vermicompost is also used. It is procured from suppliers. Soil testing is done every year at Yadrave-Magdum Agro Farm. It is done at the nearby laboratory to check on different parameters of the soil. Drip irrigation has been installed at the farm and it has made the work easy. It was bought through the government subsidy. The procedure of getting subsidy was easy as informed by Mr. Pankaj. Information on new machinery and farming techniques is gathered by participating in the various agri fair and exhibitions held at Pune and Sangali. Further, being a student, Mr. Pankaj updates himself continuously on the latest farming methodologies as part of his curriculum.  “We sell our farm produce where we get better price. Since last two years we are selling grapes in Mumbai market(mandi). We sell to wholesalers, middleman and even to direct buyers,” shares Mr. Pankaj. Banana primarily is sold to wafer producing companies and left over quantity is sold again in Mumbai market along with grapes. Sugarcane goes to sugar factory for sale. Networking with fellow farmers helps in identifying the demand of produce at the processing factories. “We farmers share the contacts, then we visit the factories, discuss the requirements and other terms which lead to the deal of selling our produce to these factories,” he adds. Presently pursuing his MBA in Agri Business, Mr. Pankaj Magdum plans to take experience in marketing of agri products. Later his end goal is to utilize all his learning and experience of his father by taking a big step to establish agro processing company. He is determined to set up processing unit where he can utilize banana grown in his own farm to make banana wedges and chips along with other products.
