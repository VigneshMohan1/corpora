Programme/Schemes administered by the Credit Division Pilot Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) 1. The efforts have been made to bring more farmers under the fold of Crop Insurance by introducing a Pilot Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) as announced in the Union Budget 2007 in selected areas on pilot basis. WBCIS is intended to provide insurance protection to the farmers against adverse weather incidence, such as deficit and excess rainfall, high or low temperature, humidity etc. which are deemed to impact adversely the crop production. It has the advantage to settle the claims within shortest possible time. The WBCIS is based on actuarial rates of premium but to make the scheme attractive, premium actually charged from farmers have been restricted to at par with NAIS. The difference between actuarial rates and premium actually paid by farmers are borne by the Government (both Centre and State concerned on 50:50 basis). Besides this a cap on premium payable by farmers for annual commercial/horticultural crops has been provided. Further, to provide competitive service to the farmers, private insurance companies i.e. ICICI-Lombard, IFFCO-TOKIO, M.S Cholamandalam and HDFC-ERGO General Insurance Companies have also been involved for implementation besides Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC). Five more Private General Insurance Company namely, Tata AIG, Royal Sundaram Alliance, Future Generali India, L & T and Reliance General Insurance Company Ltd. has also been permitted for undertaking crop insurance business from Kharif 2013 season. 2.
