The overarching goal of the SIBER program is to motivate and coordinate international interest in Indian Ocean research in order to improve our understanding of the role of the Indian Ocean in global biogeochemical cycles and the interaction between these cycles and marine ecosystem dynamics. This understanding will be required in order to predict the impacts of climate change, eutrophication and harvesting on the global oceans and the Earth System and it is fundamental to policy makers in the development of management strategies for the globally important Indian Ocean.              Events Info European Geosciences Union, General Assembly 2014, Vienna | Austria | 27 April – 02 May 2014 IMBER Open Science Conference from 23-27 June, 2014 at Bergen, Norway Read more...
