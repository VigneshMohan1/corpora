One of the great privileges that comes with the position is the opportunity to interact with individuals, groups and organizations across the state, and through that interaction gain real-world insights about how we, as stewards of the land-grant mission, can help Oklahomans improve the quality of life for themselves, their families and their communities. Our successes have always been measured by how we help those we serve succeed.
