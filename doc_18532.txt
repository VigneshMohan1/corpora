But the circumstances were entirely different immediately after the state was carved out of Bihar. Jharkhand Police had a combined state of seven battalions in all, which was, needless to mention, not up to the standards. But, the police of Jharkhand did not lose its focus and did their utmost to minimize crime in their own humble way. As a matter of fact, the police at Jharkhand put up an inspiring act as they got hold of the culprits and brought them to trial in front of the court of law. Soon, the police in Jharkhand was strengthened by the much anticipated addition of two more battalions with a female battalion soon to enter the arena of Jharkhand. The Government had also resolved that they would also procure all sorts of facilities to the police department as far as vehicle, buildings, firearms and other related stuff are concerned. This refurbishment of the infrastructure of the police had further augmented their power and made them more technically sound.
