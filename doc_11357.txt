Salient features   Ideally suitable for hilly terrains with undulating slope   Suitable for estate crops like tea, coffee etc.   Suited to crops like groundnut, cotton and the crops which are not susceptible to easy flower shedding   30 – 40 % saving in cost than conventional irrigation Water requirement of field crops with sprinkler irrigation system: Crop Actual water used (mm) Water saving over surface irrigation (%) WUE Kg/ha/mm Groundnut 390 24.7 5.13 Cotton 308 50.5 9.8 Soybean 380 50.0 4.77 Blackgram 140 50.0 8.82 Lucerne 124   63.0 5. General constraints and remedies Initial cost for installation is high Land holdings are small Equipment has a long life of 10 years Grouping of farmers to operate the system will minimize the cost per unit holding One kilogram per square centimeter pressure is needed to operate one sprinkler to cover a diameter of 12 m. Training the farmers will equip them with the knowledge about sprinkler Periodical checkup of nozzles to avoid blocking and proper coverage of diameter Wind distorts the sprinkler pattern and affect uniformity   | Home | Seasons & Varieties | Tillage | Nutrient Management | Irrigation Management | Weed Management | Crop Protection | Cost of Cultivation | © All Rights Reserved.
