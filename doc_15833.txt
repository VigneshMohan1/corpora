The counting of the votes will be held on February 10. After its historic victory in General Elections, the BJP is confident of getting a clear majority in the elections to the Delhi Legislative Assembly 2015. While the Congress will try hard to regain its lost ground, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has its political future at stake in this year’s Assembly polls in Delhi. In the 2013 Assembly elections, the newborn Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won as many as 28 seats, while the Congress that ruled the capital for three consecutive terms, faced a drubbing as it could win only 8 out of the 70 Assembly constituencies. The Bharatiya Janata Party registered a credible performance, winning 32 seats, but it fell short by four seats to reach the majority mark. AAP President Arvind Kejriwal shot to fame by defeating Sheila Dikshit in the New Delhi constituency with a margin of over 25,000 votes. He formed the AAP government with the outside support of the Congress. But his government lasted only for 49 days as he resigned from the Chief Minister’s over the issue of Jan Lokpal Bill on 14th February 2014 . The Delhi Assembly was since then kept in suspended animation and the state governed through President's Rule. In November 2014, the Assembly was dissolved, paving the way for fresh elections. Though constitutionally Delhi is a union territory, it is a state with 70 assembly constituencies. It has its own Lieutenant Governor, the Legislative Assembly and a council of ministers headed by Chief Minister. Judiciary in Delhi consists of Delhi High Court and other lower courts. Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi The Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi is Chandra Bhushan Kumar.
