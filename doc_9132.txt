In order to control this we need to plant more trees. Often we are planting introduced avenue trees which are soft , not with standing strong winds, not having much utility. Friends please select indigenous Timber yielding trees, medicinal trees and holy trees. You please plant saplings in your own lands and maintain it and also create awareness to your neighbours, friends and relatives and request them plant more trees.
