After setting up of Technology Mission on Cotton in February 2000, most of these developmental activities have come under the purview of TMC. Still, to supplement the efforts of State Agricultural Departments and other schemes of Government of India, CCI is continuing with few of its developmental activities as under:- Integrated Cotton Cultivation (Contract Farming) Apart from low yield per hectare, the quality of cotton produced in the country is comparatively more contaminated. While the interest of cotton farmers suffer due to higher cost of production and low productivity, the end user textile mills find it difficult to consume the available cotton – an admixture of varieties with higher percentage of trash and contamination. In order to increase production and productivity of cotton thereby increasing the per hectare of the cotton farmers as also to produce quality cotton to suit the needs of the textile industry, the momentum on integrated cotton cultivation is gaining ground through linkages amongst all concerned. The farmers are expected to form associations for contract farming and textile mills and other coordinating agencies are entrusted all the extension services including various inputs and marketing support for such cotton produce. The scheme in its extended form benefit both the cotton growers through low cost of production and higher productivity and the textile mills with availability of quality cotton comparable with international standards. To give a boost to cotton production through Contract Farming, CCI is undertaking contract farming programme in all the cotton growing States since 2002-03 and signing MoUs every year with the Farmers' Association. The details of contract farming of CCI since 2006-07 are as follows: Year Area in hectares No. of farmers involved No. of villages 2006-07 32810 12882 306 2007-08 40044 11777 361 2008-09 46837 15139 294 2009-10 46272 15191 208 2010-11 48649 19847 224 2011-12 47246 16155 469 Technology Mission on Cotton Technology Mission on Cotton was launched in February'2000 in the course of IXth plan with the objective to bring about tangible improvements in the productivity and quality of cotton in the country.
