Go to the shop Murali Krishnan – Dairy Home Murali Krishnan – Dairy I am a B.Sc Zoology graduate with a P.G.Diploma in Marketing Management and I started my career with Godrej Agro vet Ltd, Chennai in 1990. I learned the feeding techniques from them. Then I was with Indian Immunologicals, a unit of NDDB for another 5 years. My association with them taught me about veterinary biologicals (vaccines), and animal Health products. My experience with dairy farmers started after that and I was visiting most of the dairy farms in south and central India on official tour as I was engaged with a multinational company selling dairy farm equipments. I was instrumental in booking a single order worth more than 5 crores to establish a high tech dairy farm in Tamil Nadu having Milking Parlour, Manure scraper, TMR Wagon, Automatic Cow id and Computerised feeding systems. I can supply automatic feeding systems, chain/hydraulic type manure scrapers, water troughs/water bowls, Cow mats etc. We are specialized people with expertise in setting up dairy farms. I had visited Turkey in 1999 to get more exposure and training in modern machinery and techniques in dairy farming. We can design an entire dairy farm housing 100, 500, 1000 cow dairy farms, with the required machineries. We also deal with Milking machines which can milk 1/2/5/10/12 cows at a time and cow housing gadgets like cow mats, barn scrapers, chaff cutters with blowers, manure scrapers, ear tags, ear tag with applicators, Hoof trimming equipments, Calf feeding bottles, barn scrapers, cow brushes etc. For more details, please get in touch with: Mr.Murali Krishnan.K. “Sri Vinayaka agencies” ”Karunamadhavam”, Opposite Medical college High School Kumarapuram, Medical College Post, Trivandrum – 695011 Tel:0471-6547288 Mobile: 09446352007/09447088234/09446980696 Email : srivinayakatvm@gmail.com   Complete this form to ask questions or get more details Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Phone (required) Your Message Quiz: 8+9=?   Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > CONSULTANTS > Murali Krishnan – Dairy Related – articles, consultants, downloads Sri.Gautam Kar’s – Chemical free cultivation of high value vegetables – Emerald Farm You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
