It is a simple Yes/No type Kit. The results are obtained within 18-48 hours. a) No Change in colour of water in the bottle = Water is fit for drinking. b) Water in the bottle turns jet black                 =  Water is unfit for drinking.   The presence of coliforms in drinking water is consistently associated with organisms that produce Hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Further, onteric bacteria such as Salmonella, Proteus, Clirobacter and some strains of Klebslella also produce H2S. This communication has been effectively used in this Kit for detection of faecal pollution in water.   If you have any questions fill the product enquiry  form above.   SKU: PRL4 .
