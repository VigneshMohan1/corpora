It specializes in offering client specific and reliable consultancy service to its customers. The turnover of the company last year was Rs. 1 crore. Since its inception, the company has seen tremendous progress in the field. It is currently cultivating 200 acres of stevia in India’s different states and undertakes high-tech agriculture cultivation, medicinal juices, and certified seeds supply in India and international market, says Mr. Pradeep Sharma, Proprietor of the company. He shares the nuances and challenges with regard to stevia industry in the present scenario. The value of the global sweetener market is currently estimated at USD 4 billion. Within this market, stevia-based sweeteners are the fastest-growing segment. Extracts from stevia’s sweet leaves are used as zero-calorie sweeteners in a wide variety of beverages including fruit juices and carbonated drinks, as well as in dairy products and table top sweeteners. In December 2011, the European Commission authorized the use of stevia glycosides in food and beverages. After the earlier clearance by regulators in the US and many other regions of the world, this marks a major breakthrough in the acceptance of stevia as a sugar substitute. However, the Government of India does not give any importance to stevia. The company aims to enable individuals to produce stevia cash crop with buy back agreement. “Our approach in this venture is concerned with how we can organize an individual farmer to join pooled and organized factors of production like land, labor and capital effectively to yield the largest net return,” shares Mr. Sharma. The stevia grown under this concept shall be fully managed by the company deploying and effectively managing resources and making use of economies of scale to realize best returns for the farmers. The marketing of farmer’s final produce i.e. dried stevia leaves is among the most important factors for any farmer considering commercial cultivation of stevia. It is not advisable for small farmers to sell it in local market as it is not sold easily in local markets. Also the demand of stevia leaves varies in market substantially, and hence the best option for farmers is to go for a buyback agreement for stevia leaves from the seller of the planting material. It can be easy and relaxed for sale of material. Mr. Sharma suggests farmers to check the internet to know about the varying prices of stevia from the right source. In the future, ACI Agro Solution plans to eradicate toxicity of chemical fertilizers and ensure only organic product development that will help and secure the environment.
