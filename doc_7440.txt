Itis the lead centre for the research on pulses in the state. This is one of the identified centres under All India Co ordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Pulses under Indian Council of Agricultural Research. The station comprises of an area of 127.46 ha with 79.47 ha under tree crops, 2.27 ha under annual crops, 6.68 ha under roads and 4.04 ha under buildings. The soil type of this centre is red lateritic and acidic (pH 4.7-6.5). The average maximum temperature is 37.8 C and the minimum temperature is 20.7 C with annual mean rainfall of 881 mm in 45 rainy days. Since its inception, the centre has made significant progress in all spheres of pulses research to improve the yield, stability and food quality of the major pulse crops suited for the rainfed and less fertile soils in the state. Mandate To evolve high yielding, pest and disease resistant pulse varieties. To evolve technologies for maximizing productivity by proper agronomic management practices in pulses To develop technologies for effectively managing the major insect pests and diseases of pulses Location The centre is situated 12 km away from Pudukkottai on the Pudukkottai-Pattukkottaimain road Technology Developed Crop Improvement Thirteen pulse varieties viz., blackgram (5 nos), greengram (3 nos), redgram (3 nos) and cowpea (2 nos) and a millet variety have been released from this centre.
