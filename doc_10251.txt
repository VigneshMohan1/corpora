Go to the shop Agriprojects Consultants Home Agriprojects Consultants Bangalore based horticulture consultants Anil Patil Agriprojects Consultants was established 35 years ago. Horticulture, animal husbandry, plantation crops, project report preparation, legal aspects, and company formation are its areas of specialization. The annual turnover of the company is more than Rs 10 lakhs. The company was established with the aim of providing technical know-how to agri entrepreneurs and to help them succeed and get funding on technology from lab to land. A team of 15, comprising agri experts like horticulturist, agronomists, plant pathologists, entomologists, plant breeders, legal experts, project consultants, CA, CS and liaison personnel, constitutes Agriprojects Consultants. “All people who look for technical support for cultivation, purchase of land, processing and those who need counseling in general are the target customers,” shares Mr. Anil Patil, Chief Consultant and Horticulturist. Marketing is done by email communication, their website and blog, and agricultureinformation.com respectively. Word of mouth advertisement by satisfied customers also drives in more clients. “We provide one stop shop where counseling on what to do, what to select as agri project, help in purchasing land, legal aspects, company formation, project report preparation, bank finance, partners induction, processing, machinery selection, getting export orders, and also services like statutory auditing of the firm etc. are provided” Mr. Patil adds. Return on investment on a land can be as low as 8 % where no technology is adopted and as high as 48 to 50 % with the right technology. This includes forward and backward linkages, value addition logic, use of economies of scale, right product and technology mix, and good management under able guidance. Speaking of challenges faced by the agriculture consultancy business, Mr. Patil says, “Many believe still that they can carry on the agri business with the help of local farmers. Fee based business is still not accepted as a service. Very high investments are needed today. The funders or banks are still ill-equipped to match this need.” He hopes to see corporate farming being adopted by government. Such a step would increase productivity, provide labor opportunity and also see foreign direct investment to agri sector. Agriprojects Consultants plans to encourage more youngsters to enter agri sector in the future. Mr. Anil Patil holds a Master’s in Horticulture and a Post graduation in business management. He served as visiting faculty at National Institute for Rural Banking, NABARD and IIT, Kharagpur.
