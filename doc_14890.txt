This movement is being spearheaded by ASHA (Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture), an informal network of hundreds of organizations and individuals across twenty states of India. Today, Indian agriculture consumes toxic chemicals which end up contaminating various natural resources and our food. Further, the government is trying to push an equally hazardous - and worse, irreversible - technology in the form of genetic modification of our crops (GM crops), in the name of reducing chemical pesticides. Evidence world over shows that pesticide use has not gone down but has increased with this technology too. The unacceptable part of this situation is that governments have allowed these toxins in our farming and food, even while there is enough and more evidence and experience on the ground to show that farming can indeed be taken up profitably without the use of such chemicals. Or GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). India For Safe Food seeks to create awareness amongst all citizens about the ill-effects of chemical pesticides and other toxins in our food, how change is indeed possible and gets citizens to make the government responsible for ensuring access to safe food for all. YOU CAN BE PART OF THIS MOVEMENT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, BY FIRST MAKING A CHANGE IN YOUR OWN FOOD PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION & PURCHASE BEHAVIOUR AND BY PUTTING APPROPRIATE PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT SO THAT POSITIVE CHANGE IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY.
