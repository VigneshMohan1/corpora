Thing - schema.org schema.org Documentation Schemas Home Thing The most generic type of item. Usage: Between 100,000 and 250,000 domains [more...] Check for open issues. Property Expected Type Description Properties from Thing additionalType URL   An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally. alternateName Text   An alias for the item. description Text   A short description of the item. image URL   or ImageObject   An image of the item. This can be a URL or a fully described ImageObject . mainEntityOfPage URL   or CreativeWork   Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For example a restaurant's home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship between the page and the primary entity. Related properties include sameAs, about, and url. The sameAs and url properties are both similar to mainEntityOfPage. The url property should be reserved to refer to more official or authoritative web pages, such as the item’s official website. The sameAs property also relates a thing to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property serves more to clarify which of several entities is the main one for that page. mainEntityOfPage can be used for any page, including those not recognized as authoritative for that entity. For example, for a product, sameAs might refer to a page on the manufacturer’s official site with specs for the product, while mainEntityOfPage might be used on pages within various retailers’ sites giving details for the same product. about is similar to mainEntity, with two key differences. First, about can refer to multiple entities/topics, while mainEntity should be used for only the primary one. Second, some pages have a primary entity that itself describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person. Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages should refer to the news article or review, respectively, while about would more properly refer to the person or product. Inverse property: mainEntity . name Text   The name of the item. potentialAction Action   Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. sameAs URL   URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Freebase page, or official website. url URL   URL of the item. Instances of Thing may appear as values for the following properties Property On Types Description about CreativeWork   or CommunicateAction   The subject matter of the content. actionOption ChooseAction   A sub property of object. The options subject to this action. Supersedes option . category Offer   or PhysicalActivity   or Invoice   or Product   A category for the item. Greater signs or slashes can be used to informally indicate a category hierarchy. characterAttribute Game   or VideoGameSeries   A piece of data that represents a particular aspect of a fictional character (skill, power, character points, advantage, disadvantage). defaultValue PropertyValueSpecification   The default value of the input. For properties that expect a literal, the default is a literal value, for properties that expect an object, it's an ID reference to one of the current values. error Action   For failed actions, more information on the cause of the failure. gameItem Game   or VideoGameSeries   An item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character. gamePlatform VideoGame   or VideoGameSeries   The electronic systems used to play video games . instrument Action   The object that helped the agent perform the action. e.g. John wrote a book with *a pen*. item ListItem   An entity represented by an entry in a list (e.g. an 'artist' in a list of 'artists')’. itemListElement ItemList   For itemListElement values, you can use simple strings (e.g. "Peter", "Paul", "Mary"), existing entities, or use ListItem. Text values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings. Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists. Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements. Use ListItem with a 'position' property in such cases. itemReviewed AggregateRating   or Review   The item that is being reviewed/rated. mainEntity CreativeWork   Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. inverse property: mainEntityOfPage . mentions CreativeWork   Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. object Action   The object upon the action is carried out, whose state is kept intact or changed. Also known as the semantic roles patient, affected or undergoer (which change their state) or theme (which doesn't). e.g. John read *a book*. purpose PayAction   or AllocateAction   or MedicalDevice   A goal towards an action is taken. Can be concrete or abstract. quest Game   or VideoGameSeries   The task that a player-controlled character, or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward. replacee ReplaceAction   A sub property of object. The object that is being replaced. replacer ReplaceAction   A sub property of object.
