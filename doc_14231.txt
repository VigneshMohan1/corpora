All the species are performing well under the treatment namely application of 2kg tank silt + bio-fertilizers and bio-nutrients. 18 months appreciable growth of Acacia hybrid in Theri Pattakarai Research Centre TANK BED AFFORESTATION Tank Bed Afforestation To evolve a suitable improved tank bed afforestation technique an experiment was conducted at Kalamavoor Modern Nursery division. Convergent technologies with gypsum, spent wash and bio fertilizers as inputs in 2 pit sizes of 30cm 3 and 45cm 3 was undertaken.  The species selected were of multi purpose utility.       Species Name Species Name Species Name Pongamia pinnata Acacia nitotica Casuarina equisetifolia Azadirachta indica Terminalia arjuna Albizzia lebbeck Tamarindus indica Syzygium cuminii Simaruba glauca At the end of first year, it was found that the species Terminalia arjuna recorded maximum survival percentage followed by Tamarind, Neem and Acacia nilotica. COASTAL AFFORESTATION Shelter Belt model experiment This experiment has been taken up during 2001 in Sambiapattinam and Dhanuskodi. The objective of the trial is to arrest the wind erosion by planting trees in different storey.
