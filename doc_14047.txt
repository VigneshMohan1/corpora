We provide our members with an independent forum to enable them to interact in an open and impartial environment with business leaders, diplomats, the media, NGOs, policy-makers, and researchers to discuss foreign policy issues and India’s interests in global affairs. As the Indian economy integrates with the global economy, Indian industry is becoming more ambitious and outward-looking. There is a need to better understand how the macro-economic dynamics and the surrounding political environment of the partner country affect bilateral trade relations. The Foreign Policy Division seeks to undertake research activities on its own and/or in conjunction with other partners. Access to FICCI’s research and scholarship, and networking with other members and international policy-makers helps provide the intellectual base for policy prescriptions and foreign policy knowledge both, Indian and international. Through FICCI, Indian businesses and individuals articulate their unique foreign policy objectives based on responsible scholarship. This division works closely with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Government of India. It organizes workshops, seminars, and conferences to bring together policy-makers, academicians, industry representatives, the civil society, and the media to create a more informed understanding on issues of foreign policy interest. The Division’s objective is to serve as a platform for distinguished scholars, business leaders, and policy-makers from around the world to enter into discussions on global trade and political themes of interest to India Inc. Some of the benefits the Foreign Policy Division offers members interested in foreign affairs are: Invitations to attend foreign policy events Opportunities to engage leading policy-makers through our meetings, discussions and publications Invitations to exclusive events with leading figures in global business, politics and academia Access to FICCI’s wide network of research scholars and experts across the globe   Contact: FICCI, Federation House, Tansen Marg, New Delhi 110 001 T: +91-11-23487506 F: +91-11-23320714 Members' Helpline Allied Organisations Forums Councils Task forces Invest India Special Initiatives Forums of Parliamentarians FICCI B2B Careers Facilities Branding Manual Tenders Useful Links Subscribe
