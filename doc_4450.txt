Introduction 1. The National Population Register (NPR) is a Register of usual residents of the country. It is being prepared at the local (Village/sub-Town), sub-District, District, State and National level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. A usual resident is defined for the purposes of NPR as a person who has resided in a local area for the past 6 months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next 6 months or more.   B. Objectives 2.    The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars.   C. Demographic Particulars 3.    The following demographic details of every individual are required for every usual resident: Name of person Relationship to head of household Fatherâ€™s name Motherâ€™s name Spouseâ€™s name (if married) Sex Date of Birth Marital status Place of birth Nationality (as declared) Present address of usual residence Duration of stay at present address Permanent residential address Occupation/Activity Educational qualification                      4.    The initial collection of demographic particulars has been done by visiting each and every household in the country and canvassing a questionnaire. These questionnaires have been scanned. Using the scanned images, data entry of the particulars has been done.                                                   5.    Persons who have not been covered in the initial enumeration would be required to furnish the required information at designated NPR Centres.   D. Biometric Particulars 6.   The following biometric details of every individual are required for every usual resident: Photograph 10 fingerprints 2 Iris prints   7.   The biometrics are collected for persons of age 5 years and above by conducting camps in the local area. In the initial stage, two camps are being held in every local area. In case an individual misses both these camps, she/he would have to visit the designated Centre for furnishing the biometrics.   E. De-duplication and issue of Unique Identification Numbers 8.   Once the collection of demographic and biometric data is completed, the data base is subjected to process of biometric de-duplication based on the fingerprints and Iris attributes. Each individual is then issued a Unique Identification Number called â€˜Aadhaarâ€™. A separate organization called the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has been set up for this purpose.   F. Publication 9.   The biographic data along with the photograph and UID number is then printed and displayed in the local area (Local Register of Usual Residents) for inviting claims and objections from the public at large. The lists are also scrutinized by the local officials and vetted by the local bodies called â€˜Gram Sabha/Ward Committeeâ€™. This process of social audit brings in transparency and equity.   G. Claims and objections 10.   Local Government officials at the local, sub-district, district and state level have been designated to deal with claims and objections. A grievance redressal mechanism is also in place to ensure time-bound disposal of such claims.   H. Finalisation of NPR Data base 11.   Once all claims and objections have been dealt with and the corrections carried out, the local officials authenticate the data base by digitally signing it. This data base is then sent to the highly secure Central data base for permanent storage.   I. Personalization and Production of Identity (smart) Cards 12.   12. Resident Identity Cards are being issued to residents of coastal villages under the NPR. A proposal to roll out a scheme to issue Resident Identity Cards to all usual residents in the country who are of 18 years of age and more on the same pattern is under consideration of the Government.   13.   The Resident Identity Card is a smart card which has a micro-processor chip of 64 Kb capacity. The demographic and a few biometric attributes of each individual will be personalized in this chip. This would enable off-line authentication of individual at remote locations using hand-held devices.     J. Maintenance of the NPR database 14.   A mechanism to continuously update the database is being formulated. Under this scheme, capacity will be created at the level of the sub-District to continuously update the database. Besides catering to birth and deaths, alteration in name & address etc. is also being contemplated under this scheme. A virtual National network will be set up for this purpose.   The NPR Process
