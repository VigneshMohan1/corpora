For the years prior to 2010, Dataweb will continue to show import and export data as originally issued by the Census Bureau with no revisions. The USITC Interactive Tariff and Trade DataWeb provides U.S. international trade statistics and U.S. tariff data to the public full-time and free of charge. All trade data are compiled from official data retrieved from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce). When using these data, the Commission suggests that the following citation be used: U.S. International Trade Commission Interactive Trade DataWeb (USITC DataWeb), using data retrieved from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (accessed [date data retrieved from DataWeb]). All tariff data are from the U.S. International Trade Commission, and should be so cited with an access date.
