NATIONAL PROJECT FOR CATTLE AND BUFFALO BREEDING &amp;#40NPCBB&amp;#41 NATIONAL PROJECT FOR CATTLE AND BUFFALO BREEDING (NPCBB) Genetic improvement is a long term activity and Government of India has initiated a major programme from October 2000, “National Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding”(NPCBB) over a period of ten years, in two phases each of five years duration, with an allocation of Rs 402 crore for the 1stphase and Rs775.87 crore for 2nd Phase. National Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding envisages genetic up gradation and development of indigenous breeds on priority basis. OBJECTIVES OF THE SCHEME: (a) to arrange delivery of vastly improved artificial insemination service at the farmers doorstep; (b) to progressively bring under organized breeding through artificial insemination or natural service by high quality bulls, all breedable females among cattle and buffalo within a period of 10 years; (c) to undertake breed improvement programme for indigenous cattle and buffalo breeds so as to improve their genetic qualities as well as their availability. COMPONENTS OF THE SCHEME: (a): streamlining storage and supply of Liquid Nitrogen by sourcing supply from industrial gas manufacturers and setting up bulk transport and storage systems for the same, (b): introduction of quality bulls with high genetic merit, (c): promotion of private mobile A.I. service for doorstep delivery of A.I., (d): conversion of existing stationery government centres into mobiles centres, (e): quality control and certification of bulls and services at sperm stations, semen banks and training institutions, (f): study of breeding systems in areas out of reach of A.I. and (g): Refresher training to existing AI workers, basic training to rural unemployed youth, training to professionals and organization of farmers orientation programmes (h): institutional restructuring by way of entrusting the job of managing production and supply of genetic inputs as well as Liquid Nitrogen to a specialized autonomous and professional State Implementing Agency. PROGRESS OF THE SCHEME: The 1st phase of the project started in October 2000 and twenty -seven States and one UT are participating under the project and financial assistance the tune of Rs 364.76 crores has been released to these States including an amount of Rs 16.27 crore released during current year upto November 2007. EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT: (a): About 80% of the total adult females among the cattle and buffaloes will be brought under the organized breeding activity (AI or natural service); (b): the project will provide self-employment to about 20,000 private AI practitioners to provide delivery of AI at the farmer’s doorstep; (c): improved coverage will result in production of 20 million improved females (7.32 million buffaloes, 8.50 million crossbreds and 4.18 million purebred indigenous cattle); (d): about 80,000 pedigreed bulls for natural service are proposed to be inducted in the areas out of the reach of AI. This will enhance the productivity of nondescript stock, though at a slower rate but at a much wider scale, gradually transforming their genetic make up to that of descript breeds; (e): the project will enhance rural self-employment opportunities and increase farm income. The benefits of the project will flow directly to the farm families as incremental income; (f): the project will completely modernize the AI network and lay the foundation for establishment of the Central Monitoring Cell for certification of semen, semen stations and AI bulls so as to ensure quality of breeding inputs and make available trained manpower to sustain the AI network; FINANCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS: (Rs in crore) Allocation 2000-01 2001- 02 2002- 03 2003- 04 2004-05 2005- 06 2006-07 2007- 08 (upto Nov 2007 BE 44.00 46.00 50.00 48.00 55.00 95.00 106.00 51.00 RE 26.35 27.00 30.00 35.00 71.0983 95.14 152.0 0 - Actual expenditur e 15.71* 41.87 41.04 35.95 67.87 90.92 119.34* * 16.27 * Rs 921.35 lakh released under the constituent schemes of NPCBB is not added, as the scheme was approved for implementation from October 2000. ** including funds released under Special Livestock and Fisheries Package for Suicide prone Districts.
