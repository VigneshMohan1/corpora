Mr. Adarsh Singh is the CEO of         the company. The company had been studying Permaculture for a few years and was in contact with some experts and teachers who shared its benefits for earth and humans. Impressed with its philosophy, the company decided to spread the awareness and hence organized permaculture training to benefit organic farmers and others. Permaculture is an integral part of the company’s organic farms to conduct regular training programs on various methods of organic farming like bio-dynamics and zero budget natural farming. Permaculture originated from two words “Permanent” and “Agriculture”. Permaculture is the conscious design of a sustainable future based on co-operating with nature & caring for the earth & its people. It is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single-product system. Permaculture, Mr. Singh believes, is much more than organic farming. Speaking of permaculture, he says, “its principles and ethics can be applied in general life, in our work, and way of living apart from food growing system. It is all about understanding how nature works and then applying those simple principles to get what we need. Let the Nature work for us rather than us fighting against Nature.” As part of permaculture, the company has started observing Nature and its pattern in its farm. It has started designing its farm accordingly and is planning to get maximum benefits from it. Through permaculture it is also saving on labor and input cost. After studying how two different crops behave, plants that complement each other are planted together. Not only does it cultivate good harvest, but it also simplifies work on the farm. Participants from different professions having different education background approach Adarsh Bio Organics to receive training on permaculture. Among these participants, some are into organic farming, some wish to create an organic & permaculture rooftop kitchen garden, and others are working professionals and businessman who want to apply it in their professional life. A maximum of 24 participants are enrolled in each training session. The courses are of international level and accredited by an international body. Trainers from other countries fly to India especially for the training. Due to this, the training sessions are slightly expensive. However, scholarship programs are offered by the company for deserving organic farmers and students. Last year, the company conducted two small sessions like “Introduction to Permaculture” and “Free Talk on Permaculture” as the experts had limited time. This year, short orientation programs to reach to maximum people well in advance will also be conducted apart from the two main permaculture courses PDC (Permaculture Design Course) spanning to 12 days and Permaculture Hands on Training spanning to 6 Days.  Adarsh Bio Organics is developing an organic farm as model and research farm where all stakeholders can come, practice, learn and network with each other for sustainable food production system.
