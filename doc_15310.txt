Varieties   Sree Padma: The crop matures in 8-9 months. Cooked tubers are free from acridity Top... SeedsAndCultivation   Seeds and sowing T uber cut-pieces weighing about 1 kg are ideal for planting. Dip the pieces in cowdung slurry and allow to dry under shade before planting. After planting, cover the pit with dried leaves or other mulching materials. About 12,000 cut pieces weighing about 12 t are required for planting one hectare. Most of the seed material will germinate within one month after planting. Mealy bugs usually attack the corm in field and store. Avoid planting corms already infested. As a prophylaxis, dip the planting material in monocrotophos 0.02% for 10 minutes. Preparation of land Dig pits of 60 x 60 x 45 cm size 90 cm apart. Collect the topsoil to a depth of 15-20 cm separately and fill it after the pits are formed. Apply cowdung or compost at 2-2.5 kg/pit and mix with topsoil. Minisett planting Planting of minisett transplant and cormels gives better yield than traditional method. Cormels weighing 75-100 g each can be planted directly in nursery beds at a spacing of 90 x 30 cm.   Top... WaterManagement Top... NutrientManagement   Apply full dose of P2O5 and half the dose N and K2O (N:P2O5:K2O @ 50:50:75 kg/ha) after forty five days of planting along with intercultivation and weeding. Apply second dose of fertilizers (N and K2O @ 50:75 kg/ha) one month after the first application along with intercultivation and earthing up. Top...
