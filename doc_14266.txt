Welcome to Codex India FAO/WHO EXPERT COMMITTEES AND CONSULTATIONS From the very beginning, the Codex Alimentarius has been a science-based activity. Experts and specialists in a wide range of disciplines have contributed to every aspect of the code to ensure that its standards withstand the most rigorous scientific scrutiny. Much work is carried out in the form of collaborative studies between individual scientists, laboratories, institutes and universities and joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultations FAO and WHO provide expert scientific advice on many aspects of food quality, safety and nutrition relevant to the work of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. While not officially part of the Codex Alimentarius Commission structure, the FAO/WHO Expert Consultations provide independent scientific expert advice to the Commission and its specialist Committees and Task Forces on many aspects of food quality, safety and nutrition. A large amount of scientifically based food data has been generated by expert meetings, convened and serviced jointly by FAO and WHO. Two such groups, the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, have for many years produced internationally acclaimed data which are widely used by governments, industry and research centres. Their input into the work of the Codex Commission is of fundamental importance and the publications resulting from their activities are acclaimed international references. The evaluations performed by JECFA, like those performed by JMPR, are based on the best scientific information available, comprising inputs from many authoritative sources.
