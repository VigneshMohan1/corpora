Dear Readers, "Mr. Nallamuthu, Founder, Thumba Agro Technologies says - Which is the powerful media for getting Immediate and Latest Information for farmers?

It will be possible only when group and collective approach is there. Most of our farmers cannot access internet, and only a few educated & affluent farmers can. They can disseminate information to other members of the group.

Instead issue of leaflets, krishi, Melas, Demonstration Farms and interactive sessions with farmers will serve a better purpose. Even providing assistance to established cooperatives will be useful.

Now lots of graduates are coming towards farming, using internet which teaches new technology. But this is not possible always as a farmer will ask why he should suffer for others.

Hence we cannot tell the farmer to try it fully in his farm because he will lose a full farming season if he fails. So it has to be after the trials all these to be done. Yes to an extent the internet will give him some ideas of the different cultural practices around the world.

This is only due to the awareness of the individual and so by the encouragement from the government. Most of the areas in the north-eastern including Darjeeling Hill and seven sisters of the country still doesn’t have good connectivity of roads and so is the network, therefore there is no question on the using of internet. Again there must be some government agencies (DHO) they must make them (farmers) to know about new technologies with some demos and practicality if it is viable. If this should be privatised then i believe it would be successful due to its commercial nature.

The more you make good use of it, the more beneficial it will be for you. Currently, internet is arguably the best medium to find a wealth of knowledge and resources regarding latest technologies and developments across the sector.

Durga Prasad Rao, Proprietor and Farmer, Sai Durga Overseas says- Yes, internet is a power fool tool to learn new technologies if a farmer learns how to use it, he will surely learn how to get benefit out of it. There are agriculture fairs also for the farmers who are not literate and even the newspapers with agriculture edition covering technologies also helps. So it’s necessary to adopt new technologies time to time through any of these modes. Everyone needs to aware of all those modes and Govt. should provide more learning classes for farmer’s economic growth.
