Organic Fruit - Small Farms / Alternative Enterprises - Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension Main Page About Us Extension Offices EDIS Publications Conference Info Organic Fruit UF/IFAS Publications | Other Universities or Federal Agencies There are approximately 6,000 acres of certified organic citrus in Florida, and many more acres of citrus and other fruits are managed organically on small farms and private homes. Several commercial citrus operations work collaboratively to supply our nation’s demand for organic orange juice and other citrus products, and Florida’s blueberry market share is expanding. Identifying a market for organic fruit is the first step a producer should take before transitioning to organic. Additional costs of certification and inputs should offset potential income if the appropriate market is identified.   Some of the EDIS publications may include references to conventional inputs, but remain relevant in many regards and therefore are included here. Producers should consider that responses of root stocks and other yields reported typically reflect synthetic inputs including fertilizer and pesticides. Producers should also be aware that the National Organic Standards prohibit the use of nearly all synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and are advised to consult their certifying agency prior to changing their organic farm plan. A number of publications are presented to help producers identify pests of perennial and annual fruit, manage fertility, and care for fruit after harvest. For more information about organic fruit, please see the resources listed here or contact your local UF-IFAS County Extension office .
