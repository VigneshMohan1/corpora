Go to the shop Hydroponic Cultivation Home Hydroponic Cultivation Ms. Rakhee Sharma of Plant Genome Sciences (PGS) provides information on Hydroponic Systems and nutrients. The main products of PGS are hydroponic nutrients and green house. Company offers cultivation support and wide range of organic based synthetic nutrients which have been specially designed for all hydroponic growing medium. “Hydroponic cultivation is basically growing crops in soilless medium. It will not compensate for poor growing conditions such as improper temperature, inadequate light, or pest problems. The following basic requirements must be maintained at adequate levels for optimal growth namely nutrient solution, temperature, fresh air, shelter and support, water, mineral nutrients, light and growing media,” informs Ms. Sharma. The primary aim of any growing medium in soilless gardening system is to anchor the roots, hold moisture and provide nutrients to the plant. The medium itself is inert and will not decompose nor harbour any soil-borne pests or diseases. The plant’s complete nutritional needs are met by the special nutrient mixes that are added to the individual system. A range of growing media can be used that have been selected due to their high quality and superior capacity for holding nutrient solutions, while still retaining a good balance of oxygen and moisture. These are – • Hydroton: It is a special kiln fired clay based aggregate that is super-heated and formed into small ‘marbles’ usually between 4 mm to 16 mm in diameter. The inner core structure is porous and will absorb and release nutrient and water to the plants as required. Hydroton is not compact and thus ensures excellent aeration for the root zone • Coco peat:  This is also known as coir or coco, and is the leftover material after the fibres have been removed from the outermost shell (bolster) of the coconut. Coir is a 100% natural grow and flowering medium. • Rockwool: It is made from molten rock, basalt or ‘slag’ that is spun into bundles of single filament fibres, and bonded into a medium capable of capillary action, and are in effect protected from most common microbiological degradation. It is an inert substrate suitable for both run to waste and recirculating system. • Perlite:  Perlite is a volcanic rock that has been superheated into very lightweight expanded glass pebbles. • Vermiculite:  Vermiculite is light and has very high capacity of water retention. It is a natural mineral which expands with the application of heat and is formed by hydration of certain basaltic minerals. Visit http://bit.ly/17N8TTy to listen to complete discussion.
