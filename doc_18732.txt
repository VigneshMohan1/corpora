Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway is popularly called Western Peripheral Expressway. This expressway in Haryana will run between Kundli and Palwal. The expressway measuring 135.6 km in length, crosses four National Highways namely NH1 near Kundli, NH2 near palwal, NH8 near Manesar, NH 10 near Bahadurgarh and State Highway 13 (Gurgaon to Alwar). A flyover is being constructed at each of the National highways where the expressway crosses it. Besides, 143 underpasses and crossing passages are being constructed for vehicles and pedestrians at the places where the expressway connects to villages and towns. Several major and minor bridges are proposed to be constructed at 292 locations across the expressway. The work on the expressway will be completed in three sections. Each section will cover a stretch of 45 kms. The construction work for the expressway was planned to be completed by July 2009 initially but due to extended delays, the project is still lingering in between and travelers are waiting for a time when the expressway will be ready and their traffic problems will be eased a little. The expressway however, has only seen a growth of 64% and is not expected to be open for general public even for the next six months.
