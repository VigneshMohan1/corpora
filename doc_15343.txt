It is a medium sized shrub, which thrives well in tropical climate. It is best suited as a homestead fruit crop and prefers a rich well drained soil. Top... SelectionCriteriaForPlantingMaterials Planting materials West Indian cherry is usually raised from seedlings. Seeds are sown in well-prepared beds and when the seedlings are about 2-4 months old, they are ready for planting. Vegetative propagation by means of hardwood cuttings along with leaves is feasible, though the percentage of rooting is very low. Air layering is highly successful when treated with IBA. Layers strike roots within 3-4 weeks. When the roots peep out though the ball of moss or coir pith, the stem may be severed in stages. The rooted shoot is potted after removing the polythene film and kept in shade till new flushes appear. Plants may be hardened in full sunlight prior to transplanting. Chip budding, shield budding, side grafting and veneer grafting are also successful to a limited extent. Top... Varieties Two distinct types are seen. Pink flower type Flowers are pink and are born in clusters in leaf axils. Fruits are large in size (about 6 g). White flower type Flowers are white and are born in clusters in leaf axils. Fruits are small (about 1 g) and orange coloured when fully ripe. Top... SeedsAndCultivation   Planting For planting, pits of size 1 x 1 x 1 m are made, 6 m apart. Fill the pit with topsoil and 10 kg cowdung. After planting, mulching may be done with dry leaves to conserve moisture. July to December is considered to be the best time for planting. Irrigation once in four days during early stages of growth up to one year of planting and later on, once in 7-10 days is necessary. Pruning Pruning is done once in a year to maintain regular shape. Pruning consists of removal of dried and diseased wood and also the drooping branches. Top... WaterManagement Top... NutrientManagement Manuring A fully-grown, bearing plant should be top dressed with fertilizers @ 100 g N, 160 g P 2 O 5 and 260 g K 2 O.
