It requires much warmth and sun. Cool weather and wind hamper the growth. Medium heavy or light soils are preferred. Highly polymorphic species; annual herb, erect and bushy, 20-60 cm tall, or twining with stems 2-3 m long; with a taproot and nitrogenous nodules; leaves alternate, green or purple, trifoliolate, stipulate, petiolate, a marked pulvinus at base; leaflets ovate, entire; acuminate, 6-15 cm long, 3-11 cm wide; flowers in lax, axillary few-flowered (12) racemes, zygomorphic, variegated, white, pink, or purplish, ca 1 cm long; pods slender, green, yellow, black, or purple, cylindrical or flat, 8-20 cm long, 1-1.5 cm wide; seeds 4-6-(12), usually glabrous, sometimes puberulent, beak prominent; seeds white, red, tan, purple, grey or black, often variegated, reniform, oblong or globose, up to 1.5 cm long, endosperm absent; 100 seeds weigh 10-67 g, depending on cv; germination phanerocotylar. In Kerala this crop can be grown in the high ranges of elevation more than 1000 m, throughout the year. The crop being susceptible to ground frost in higher altitudes (above 1400 m), adequate protection should be given during January-February. Light sandy-loam to clayey-loam soils with good drainage are best suited for the crop. Top... SelectionCriteriaForPlantingMaterials   Top... Varieties   There are two types of French beans viz., pole beans and bush beans. Pole beans : Kentucky Wonder Bush beans: Contender, Premier, YCD-1, Arka Komal, Tender Green Top... SeedsAndCultivation   Sowing Prepare land thoroughly by ploughing. Raised beds are not essential for bush beans. For pole beans, raised beds are advantageous. Spacing of 30 cm x 20 cm is recommended. Top... WaterManagement   Top... NutrientManagement   Manuring Apply basal dose of 20 t/ha of FYM and N:P2O5:K2O @ 30:40:60 kg/ha. Top dressing with 30 kg N/ha may be given 20 days after sowing. Top... WeedManagement   Aftercultivation Provide support, 1 to 1.5 m long for trailing the plants. First weeding can be given about 4 weeks after sowing and second weeding will be essential 50 days later. Pods become ready for harvest in 50-60 days in the case of bush beans and in 70-80 days for the pole beans. The average yield of green pods is 8-10 t/ha. Top... Plant Protection   Treat the seeds with copper based fungicides. Apply malathion 0.05% for controlling aphids. Top... Harvesting   Top... Processing   Top...
