With appreciation for National Horticulture Boardâ€™s notable history, I am delighted to welcome you as its new Managing Director. I am honoured that Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India has placed trust in me to lead this institution. I consider this assignment as one of the most challenging having huge potential to impact and develop the horticulture sector which plays an ever increasing role in the well-being and income generation of people at large. As Head of the Division of Fruits & Horticultural Technology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, I have been associated with the horticulture sector through research, education, extension, harvest & post harvest management and infrastructure development. This would help me in formulating the strategies, evolving the appropriate schemes, establishing alliance between knowledge and enabling environment for sustainable development of horticulture with the aim of raising the farmerâ€™s income at the same time achieving environmental and nutritional security. We would try to ensure the timely decisions for effective implementation of schemes to benefit the stakeholders. We at NHB are committed to simplify the procedures with greater uses of IT based decision support system for greater effectiveness in our programmes while reaching stakeholders. Together with NHB staff, it will be our priority to work on measures to bring in transparency, effectiveness and vibrancy to achieve the goals of National Horticulture Board. I am looking forward to the start of my term of office on February 19, 2015, when we will embark on our future together. We welcome your suggestions to make the organization more responsive and effective. With best wishes, (A. K.
