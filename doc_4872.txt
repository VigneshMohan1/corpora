Dated 18.6.2010.   To The Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, All States/UTs (As per list)   Subject : Revised Administrative Approval & Guidelines of Central Sector Scheme “Integrated Development of Small Ruminants and Rabbits”. Sir, In continuation of administrative approval and guidelines issued vide letter of even number dated 20 th May, 2009 and letter of even number dated 13 th April 2010, I am directed to convey revised administrative approval of the Government of India for implementation of above mentioned scheme during 2010-11 and rest of XIth Plan period. The scheme has been approved during XIth Plan period with allocation of Rs 134.825 crore and outlay of Rs 42.00 crore for financial year 2010-11. Major components of the scheme are: (i) creation of small ruminant development fund to foster area / cluster-based integrated development as viable commercial activity; (ii) strengthening of infrastructure, human resources, institutions and rearers’ organizations for rapid improvement of small ruminants and rabbits; (iii) developing skill-pool of NGOs for taking up development projects on PPP mode; (iv) resource mapping in 126 nos. identified districts (Annexure-V) for sheep, goat and rabbits rearing and in terms of raw material source as well as meat consumption pattern and development of 108 clusters for intensive development of sheep, goat and rabbit during XIth Plan. Integrated development of potential clusters will be implemented by NABARD and this component is modified to “Provision of 25% back ended capital subsidy of project cost (33.33%) in hilly areas and Northeastern States and for SC/ST farmers in all the areas) to entrepreneurs taking up breeding/commercial rearing of sheep/goat/rabbits. Similar support will be made available to entrepreneurs/NGOs and entities taking up sheep/goat/rabbit farming with bank loan in place of interest free loan to extent of 50% of project cost”. Activities relating to State Government institutions will be undertaken by designated State Implementing Agency (SIA). For institutional restructuring, every participating State will be required to nominate / designate an existing organization as State Implementing Agency charged with responsibility of carrying on institutional restructuring and remodeling of State Government Institutions to suit mandate and purpose of the scheme. A suitable semi-Government organisation dealing with small ruminants & rabbits exists in most states. Each participating State will constitute a State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLMC), chaired by Principal Secretary / Secretary of Animal Husbandry Department in the State. At Central level, Central Monitoring Committee will be constituted to monitor progress of projects. A copy of modalities of implementation and brief description of activities proposed to be taken up under this scheme and conditions laid down by Ministry of Finance for implementation of the scheme, are enclosed as Annexure-I, II, III, IV, V & VI respectively.

Jayal) Under Secretary to the Government of India   Annexure-I   Modalities of implementation and brief description of activities proposed to be taken up under the scheme Integrated Development of   Small Ruminants and Rabbits.   A. Modalities of Implementation:   The scheme will be implemented in a bimodal approach comprising of a Small Ruminant Development Fund operated by NABARD and a State Implementing Agency (SIA) designated by the State Government undertaking the activities relating to State Government institutions. There will be a State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLMC) constituted by NABARD in each State covered under the scheme, which will be chaired by Principal Secretary / Secretary of the Department of Animal Husbandry in the State. The SLMC will have as its Member a representative each from: (i) Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. (ii) Lead Bank in the State. (iii) State Animal Husbandry Department. (iv) An NGO actively operating in the State. (v) NABARD (vi) NCDC The Committee will liaise with the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries (GOI), State Government Departments, prominent NGOs and NABARD’s Head Office. State Office of NABARD will be the Secretariat for SLMC. 2. At the National Level, a Central Monitoring Committee (CMC) will be constituted to approve innovative projects to be sanctioned directly by the Department and to formulate operational plan and policy with respect to the scheme. Besides this, there will be an Empowered Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary (ADF) will be constituted to consider escalation of units cost and other relevant issues. 3. The States participating in the project will identify a suitable Semi-Government Agency and designate the same as the State Implementing Agency (SIA) for implementation of the project. The primary responsibility of the SIA will be to spearhead Institutional Restructuring as it relates to sheep, goat and rabbit development. The SIA will also be charged with responsibility of developing synergy among prominent stakeholders concerned with development of these species in the State as well as up-gradation of institutional infrastructure. 4. For commercial rearing units, the intended beneficiaries are landless and marginal farmers. Preference would be given to women. For breeding Farms and Open Nucleus Flocks, the beneficiaries will be traditional breeders as well as entrepreneurs/NGOs/Companies etc. Entrepreneurs will be primary beneficiary of the interventions relating to market linkages.   B. Monitoring Arrangement:   1. At the State level, the scheme will be monitored every quarter by the State Level Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee. NABARD Head Office will also monitor physical and financial implementation of the project and submit returns to the Department of Animal Husbandry Dairying & Fisheries, Government of India. The SIA will report progress of their activities to the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, Government of India. 2. A mechanism for monitoring performance of the State Livestock Breeding Farms and other infrastructure is to be evolved by concerned Department of State Government and the SIA. The SIA will report progress of their activities to the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries, Govt. of India every quarter. 3. The CMC will meet at least twice in a year to review progress of implementation of the scheme.   C. Activities proposed to be taken up:   I. Launch & Promotion of the Scheme: Since participation of beneficiaries is a key to success of the scheme, NABARD as the principal implementing agency will initiate action to identify prominent NGOs who are already active in the field and have experience of dealing with livestock owners so that they can be supported for organizing farmers / rearers. Best of such NGOs will also be charged with responsibility of forming local NGOs to act as guardian for the new growers/rearers. Repeated financing of same NGOs may be avoided. (a) It was decided that detailed guidelines regarding capacity building in NGO Sector, will be prepared before launch of Scheme. (b) It was decided that interest accrued on project and amount of loan recovered from beneficiaries should be computed annually and adjusted against future releases to corpus. (c) It was further decided that for insurance, competitive bids may be invited from insurance companies and farmers in project area trained and made aware of benefits accruing out of insurance. To propagate insurance in non-scheme animals, insurance companies may be advised to develop insurance module for rabbits in general and Angora rabbits in particular. For the purpose of insurance coverage, 4% of the average value of animals will constitute the premium and 75% of the premium will be borne on the project. An average value of Rs 2000/- will be assumed for small ruminants. Rearers will also be insured under a composite insurance programme. II. Intensive Cluster Development and Small Ruminant Development Fund: (a) There will be 48 intensive clusters for sheep and 60 for goats. In each cluster, 100 commercial units of sheep and/or goat will be set up, each unit will comprise of 40 female and 2 male animals. Breeding farms for sheep and goat breeds in private sector with minimum flock size of 500 female and 25 males will also be supported. Units of Angora Rabbit farms and units of broiler rabbit farms will be established with cluster approach. Establishment of breeding farms with satellite grower units will also be supported so as to ensure timely supply of breeding material to the rabbit rearers. III. Institutional restructuring and grants-in-aid to State Implementing Agencies: The State Implementing Agency (SIA) will orchestrate all activities and coordinate with partners. The SIA will be eligible for managerial grant to the tune of 2% of the turnover in scheme-related activities subject to a maximum of Rs 30.00 lakh per year. The Government institutions charged with responsibility of sheep, goat and rabbit development may be restructured to conform to the SIA concept which is already popular since launch of the National Project of Cattle and Buffalo Breeding. IV. Improvement of high fecundity breeds and exploitation of fecundity gene to improve productivity in indigenous breeds: Garole breed of sheep is known to have Fec. B gene which leads to twining. Twining is also common in some other sheep breeds as also in Black Bengal Goats. Development programmes in breeding tracts of these breeds to improve body weight and establishment of bio-technology centers to exploit genes responsible for high fecundity will be taken up on a regional basis. Under the bio-technology centers, programmes will be undertaken to attain flock strength of 500 animals which are homozygous for the high fecundity genes. In the breeding tracts, programmes will be taken up towards improvement in body weight in these breeds through appropriate nutritional, genetic and other interventions. V. Strengthening and revival of potential sheep/goat breeding farms and their corporatization: There are about 60 sheep breeding farms and over 50 goat breeding farms under State Governments. Grants to the tune of Rs 50.00 lakh will be made available to select government farms having potential of revival / corporatization. Such farms should attain minimum flock strength of 1000 females and 50 males. Civil construction in the revival package should not exceed 10% of the total cost. Such farms will be required to develop a revival package so as to become self-sustaining within a period of four years. Assistance under the project will also be available so as to enable the State authorities engage an appropriate consultant for chalking out a revival plan for the farm(s). This activity will be implemented by the designated State Implementing Agency. VI. Creation of open nucleus breeding flocks in collaboration with farmers: These flocks will have strength of 500 females and 25 males of one breed, and will be required to follow pure breeding and maintain production, growth and reproduction records to enable implementation of a scientific selection and breeding programme for the flock. Ten such flocks will be established for each indigenous breeds and 20 breeds are proposed to be covered during the 11 th Plan. Funds required for setting up the units will be provided by providing credit support with subsidy from banks who will select the collaborating farmers, guide them into the programme and supervise progress. The SIA will undertake to provide technical support and inputs to such activity in the vicinity of the revived breeding farms so as to augment supply of breeding material and improvement in indigenous breeds. VII. Projects for integrated development of rabbits (Angora & Broiler): A number of pilot projects have been successfully implemented in the country, which have established the potential of rabbit rearing, both for fibre and meat, as a commercially remunerative activity. Accordingly, rabbit rearing activities will be promoted through banks with credit linked subsidy.   Annexure-IV   Conditions to be followed while implementing the scheme: 1. Interest accrued on project and amount of loan recovered from beneficiaries should be computed annually and adjusted against future releases from the corpus. 2. Repeated financing of the same NGOs may be avoided. NABARD should share the list of partner NGOs maintained with it, and their credibility ranking, with the DAHD&F. Detailed guidelines regarding capacity building in NGO Sector, will be prepared before launch of Scheme. It should be ensured that publicity campaigns should be focused on the target group for better results. 3. For each breeding farm for small ruminants, standards in terms of body weight at different ages, health protocols, etc. are to be laid down for maintenance of breeds. It needs to be ensured that a mechanism for monitoring the performance of these farms is evolved by the concerned Department of the State Government under the oversight of DAHD&F. 4. For the component on insurance (to cover the animals to be bred at the breeding units established under the Scheme), competitive bids may be invited from insurance companies; and farmers in the project area be trained and made aware of benefits accruing out of insurance. Insurance companies may be advised to develop specific insurance modules for rabbits in general and Angora rabbits in particular. 5. State Level Committees will be headed by Principal Secretary / Secretary of the Department of Animal Husbandry in the State. The proposals under “other activities germane to sheep, goat and rabbit development” will be approved by the Central Monitoring Committee and released made by DAHD&F. Innovative projects for production of value-added products may also be encouraged under the Scheme. 6. Training of bankers may not be funded from this scheme. 7. Even though a provision of Rs 4 crore has been allowed under the scheme for organizing farmers, already existing SHGs should be profited from, as far as possible, rather than forming new groups. 8. Work under the scheme, especially the component for setting up slaughter houses and retail outlets with cold storage facility, should be synergised with the work of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MFPI). The component for Entrepreneurship Development could also be converged with MFPI’s scheme for the purpose. All possible assistance for developing standards of hygiene and good practices for international marketing of meat should be sought from the newly established National Poultry and Meat Processing Board. 9Model DPRs / proposals may be developed and placed in the public domain through internet for potential entrepreneurs to derive benefit from. 10. KVKs and ATMAs may be involved in the project for building up local capacities in the area.   Annexure-II   Approved Components of Integrated Development of Small Ruminants and Rabbits (IDSRR)   Sr.No. Component Pattern of Assistance Target Group/Beneficiaries Implementing Agency Allocation( Rs In crores) 1 2 3 4 5 6 I Launch and Promotion of Scheme           i) Capacity building in NGO sector GRANT NGOs/Farmers NABARD 3.00 ii) Training of Farmers and Bankers GRANT -- NABARD   3.00 iii) Pre-project potential survey and resource mapping GRANT Farmers   NABARD 5.00 iv) Organisation of farmers   GRANT -- NABARD 4.00 v) Publicity & campaign GRANT -- NABARD 3.00 Sub Total       18.00 II.
