With almost 5 decades of financing development in Asia and the Pacific, ADB leverages acquired knowledge and experience to continue improving its operations while simultaneously sharing its knowledge stock with partners and organizations for accelerated and effective development across the region. Current directions in knowledge management Finance++ is ADB's new approach to raising the development effectiveness bar. Finance++ are superior combinations of attractive financing, strategic partnerships, and high-quality knowledge to maximize and accelerate development effectiveness. ADB's Knowledge Management Directions and Action Plan, 2013-2015: Supporting "Finance++" at ADB , approved in March 2013, commits ADB to 4 goals: Prioritizing and implementing knowledge tools, techniques, and approaches known as "knowledge solutions" Enriching the quality of ADB and developing member country knowledge capabilities for development effectiveness Advancing ADB's knowledge assets, information systems, and communications Empowering and resourcing high-quality knowledge solutions. Knowledge capital ADB's experience in generating and cultivating development knowledge provides a solid foundation for the present KM action plan. ADB’s development knowledge stock is encapsulated in "knowledge solutions," a wide range of tools, techniques, and approaches that ADB uses to drive change and development in the region. These are: research on major development issues facing Asia and the Pacific and their relation to global economic governance and other major global public goods policy advisory services country diagnostics and outlook economic, sector, and thematic work technical assistance for preparing, designing, implementing, and evaluating investment operations professional and organization capacity development improving national/subregional statistical systems application of best practices in relation to all of ADB’s economic and sector and thematic domains, and pilot-testing of new development policy and approaches to public service delivery, technology, and innovation evaluation knowledge sharing and development of national, regional, and inter-regional knowledge networks. ADB's knowledge solutions are developed on the basis of ADB's own activities and in cooperation with developing member countries and/or other public and private development partners from within or outside the region. In the broadest development sense, knowledge solutions encompass activities that span a scale from upstream exploration and initial examination of development issues through the testing and application of new knowledge and assessment of results, and then broader knowledge transfer and its application. This is an interactive process and one where support for knowledge networking is important within each stage as well as to link the various stages into a coherent knowledge solutions process within and among developing member countries. Knowledge investments in people ADB invests in in-house Sector and Thematic Groups of knowledge workers (formerly, Communities of Practice or CoPs) that promote knowledge management and learning within ADB and are committed to engaging more purposefully in external partnerships. Composed of ADB staff and consultants whose collective knowledge and expertise represent ADB’s investment in its people, Sector and Thematic Groups provide expert advice on strategic directions in specific development sectors and themes, contribute their operations-based knowledge on the design of loan projects and programs, and spearhead the production of knowledge solutions. ADB also supports similar regional and international CoPs for development effectiveness. MORE Sharing knowledge ADB's Knowledge Sharing and Services Center (KSSC) supports and guides the implementation of ADB's KM action plan. The center provides cost-effective knowledge sharing and support services to ADB and external partners and organizations. KSSC supports ADB's operations departments and Sector and Thematic Groups to distill and synthesize explicit and tacit knowledge and assists them in strengthening knowledge management in developing member countries. It also supports sector and thematic skills development for ADB and ADBI staff. Currently, the KSSC is setting up an ICT-based knowledge platform for recording, storing, retrieving, and sharing knowledge within and outside ADB.
