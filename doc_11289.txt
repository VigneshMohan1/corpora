Company installs hydroponic system for producing organic green fodder round the year. The fodder is suitable for cattle, goat, sheep and poultry. “So far we have successfully installed 11 systems,” shares Mr. Mali. Hydroponic fodder makes efficient use of water, there is no leaching of nutrients into the environment, requires considerably less land ‘only 20% space’ and cereal grains can easily be sprouted in accordance with USDA’s Certified Organic Program. “This system cuts overhead expenses. The feed is cultivated within eight days cycle. It is 100% organic provided we use organic seeds,” adds Mr. Mali. The fodder is 90-95% digestible, more nutritious and has high moisture content. Hydroponic fodder also has an added advantage of increasing fertility rate and egg-laying in poultry. Initial investment is Rs. 1500 per tray and per cow 8 trays are required. “The operational cost is low which means farmer requires only four kgs of dry corn seed per day per cow and that is Rs. 40 per day per cow which completes daily green feed requirement of one cow,” explains Mr. Mali and adds, “Our system can produce 350kg of green feed (wet) at Rs 875/- with little maintenance. It takes just six to eight days for the fodder to grow from a seed into a mature plant of 25cms.” There is no loan facility available for buying and installing the hydroponics system. “We are trying for providing some financial assistance to our buyers,” informs Mr. Mali. So far response received from farmers is encouraging. “They are showing very good interest in it,” he adds. Mr. Mali holds B.E (Civil). He encourages all farmers having dairy and livestock farms to use hydroponic fodder producing system as it will be huge benefit to them.
