Assembly Elections 2013 Results Delhi Election Results Chhattisgarh Election Results MP Election Results Mizoram Election Results Rajasthan Election Results Mizoram Assembly Election 2013 The 2013 assembly elections were completed in Mizoram on 25th November 2013 with 81% voter turnout. It was a resounding victory for democracy as voting was concluded successfully in 1,1,26 stations, which included 94 sensitive ones. There are 40 seats in the state assembly of this predominantly Christian state, for which 142 candidates contested. The opposition party, Mizo National Front (MNF) will be hoping to replace the Congress as the ruling party of the state. The 2013 polls were earlier to take place on December 4. However, these had to be rescheduled owing to date clashes with important events of the Church, which would have deprived thousands of their voting right. Therefore, the Election Commission changed the polling date to November 25, 2013. The focal point of the political battle will be the New Land Use Policy (NLUP), which the Congress says has empowered the tribes of Mizoram by helping them find sustenance and food security. The MNF had earlier discontinued the NLUP on the pretext that it was benefiting only the Congress supporters. The use of militants to gain leverage in the elections has also become a ground for political mudslinging. The current state Chief Minister, Pu Lalthanhawla of the Congress, contested the 2013 polls from the Serchhip constituency. He has won six times from this seat, losing only in 1998 to K. Thangzuala of the MNF. He also contested from the Hrangturzo constituency in 2013, where he is likely to face tough competition from the Lalthansanga of the Mizoram People's Conference (MPC).
