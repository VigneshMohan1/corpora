Education fund for promoting education among children of small and marginal cotton farmers and wage labor. The focus is mainly on (a) Facilitating rural communities to undertake school enrolment campaigns to ensure 100% enrolment of children in schools; (b) Capacity building of the farmer SHG on local school education monitoring and exercising rights for demanding accountability; (c) Set up vocational training centres, esp. for girl children (school dropouts) leading to skill development (d) Scholarships to outstanding children for higher education (+2 onwards) with specific emphasis on girl children.
