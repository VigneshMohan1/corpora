Based at Pune Abhijit Savant Prerana Laboratories is the manufacturer of the largest range of water testing kits and soil testing kits in India. Its products are in use since 1985. Mr. Ravi Savant is the founder. The annual combined group annual turnover is over 3 Cr. The company’s products cover all major applications of water testing including agriculture water, industrial water, and drinking water. The soil testing kit and irrigation kit offered by the company for agricultural purpose contain everything required to test the soil and water at the site. 25000 plus testing kits are supplied annually. These kits are supplied throughout the country and also exported to Asian, African, Middle-Eastern and some European countries. The intention behind developing these products was to enable even a layman farmer to carry out the soil and water tests himself. “A lot of farmers want to get their soil tested. However, there is no facility available nearby. Hence, we made a product which could reach up to the farmers for their primary soil testing needs, instead of farmers going in search of facilities, sometimes ending up with unreliable end-results,” shares Mr. Abhijit Savant, Co-owner. The products have been made extremely simple to use, by eliminating complex processes used by other products. They are compact, light-weight and can be carried anywhere. The soil testing kit can check five main parameters i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, ph and organic carbon. The testing kits also check for calcium, magnesium, free lime and sulfur in soil. If a soil sample is not collected in a scientific manner, it will not be a correct representative of the farm. Therefore the products come with a user manual in English/Hindi/Marathi along with a demo VCD. The kit also contains a booklet regarding the methodology of soil sample collection and adjusting the fertilizer dosage for different crops after the tests are carried out based on the readings obtained. The kits are very economical and provide results in quick time. Since the primary customers of the company are farmers, prices of its products have been kept low. The cost of testing samples is economical as compared to getting the samples tested from private labs. The company receives inquiries via internet. It also has ads running in various magazines relating to agriculture. “We showcase our products in some major agriculture exhibitions and receive overwhelming response. Forums like AgricultureInformation.com also provide a great way to reach out to farmers from all over,” Mr. Abhijit adds. Prerana Laboratories’ testing kits for drinking water analysis have been evaluated and validated by SIIR, Delhi under UNICEF protocol. Its soil testing kit has been evaluated and validated by MPKV, Rahuri, the topmost agri University of Maharashtra. The company is currently making efforts to develop new products in soil and water testing which can be beneficial to the farming community in the years to come. Mr. Abhijit is a Graduate in Chemistry from Fergusson College, Pune, with PG in Marketing Management from Symbiosis University, Pune. He has been involved with the company for five years now.
