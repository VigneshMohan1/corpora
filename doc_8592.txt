Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Print Bookmark Overview Located in the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan is an oil-rich country whose gross national income per capita has increased approximately tenfold since 2001. Consequently, in 2013, ADB upgraded Azerbaijan to a Category C developing member country. Economic growth has been spurred by the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, high levels of public expenditure, and substantial reforms to support a market-based economy. Despite robust growth, the economy of Azerbaijan remains largely dependent upon the extraction and production of fossil fuels.
