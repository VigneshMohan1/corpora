Hundreds of farmer organisations, cooperatives, radio stations, development partners, as well as individual farmers have over the past two years received copies of the DVD, baptised under the name “Fighting Striga”. A follow up study in Mali showed that most of the people who received the DVDS were able to find a way to watch them. For example the school or a neighbour had a DVD player and TV set, a laptop, or a portable DVD player with built-in screen for watching entertainment videos.  Most of the villagers watched the videos on their own, without an extensionist to answer questions. These and other studies on the use and impact of videos are summarised as one-page summary sheets available on the Access Agriculture website under Impact studies . Based on the continued demand, ICRISAT decided to order 10,000 more DVDs. “It is a small investment that creates great impacts,” says ICRISAT’s regional director for West and Central Africa, Dr. Tabo Ramadjita.
