One method to manipulate flowering is to use the plant growth regulator, paclobutrazol. The post- harvest application of a small amount of paclobutrazol to the soil significantly promotes flowering and fruiting in the following year. Trials over the last two years have shown the following benefits from the treatment: •A significant increase in flowering leading to increased yields. •The early flowering considerably enhanced fruit maturity. Treated trees flowered three to four weeks early, which reduced the time to fruit maturity by at least two weeks. •Visually, the fruit developed a better external colour.
