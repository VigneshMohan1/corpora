I disagree with the quote genuine organic farmer never starves, how can the word organic can uplift the farmers from their obstacles - you should quote some reason - I am in search of what is organic for the past two years, i met and discuss over phone several farmers they believed to do organic agriculture. there are lot of definitions for that. As i am a Realtor exclusively for agriculture lands from 2006, i earned practical knowledge from the existing farmers and city man turned farmer, IT man turned farmer, i could conclude some thing only after getting reply shajath ali shajath@gmail.com 9698816786 Reply With Quote May 15th, 2014 #3 editorialteam Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 1,063 Mr. Santanu Kumar Patra, Subarnarekha Agri Services says- Yes, most of the farmers are struggling. But I have thousands of farmers who are successful. Agriculture is mother of everything. Nowadays, sons forget their parents. It is a selfish world. Let’s hope mother, father, senior citizens and above all farmers are honored. Otherwise time will compel them to obey it.

Ramakrishnan, Santhosh Farms says- Not only the farmers are in crisis today , they are not at all recognized by the society. This is a bad sign for the ugly future of the society. You can stop any work in the world , the world will be moving on. But if you stop the agriculture, the world will come to a stand still. No one can live without food, and none other than a farmer can give you food. India , being a rich country in enjoying the sun light through out the year , can easily feed to many countries. Importing food items from other countries is a shame to our nation. It is done for the benefits of a handful of leaders in the government. A proverb “ When it darkens too much means , the dawn is nearer “ ……. Is the only answer I can give as a reply to the bad conditions of farmers today. They are not able to educate their children properly. , due to the high expenses on education. The pity is , once they educate their children, they easily compare and select other fields for easy earning with recognition by the society.

High cost of organic farming i.e. seeds, organic fertilizers, medicines/ sprays that can be used. 2. Limited and unorganized market available for organic foods. 3.Markets only in big cities. No buyers from the farmer at village or small city level.

Deep down in debt at all times the farmer struggles to make the lines meet – Organic farming as a viable alternative would make galloping strides only if a determined awareness is created across all levels. People from all walks of like including the government should put a strong foot forward to halt this ever growing monster. After all if thousands of crores can be given as subsidies for poisonous chemical substances, cant a miniscule percentage of the same be given as subsidies for healthy eco-friendly farming practices for the well-being of mankind. If that happens then organic farming practices can also become an industry itself.

No one is ready to believe the farmers including financial institutions like banks. These and many other things lead to starvation always.

The crisis we see are all created by us and are not coming out of blue. We need to plan much better and produce and store the commodities in a better condition and sell them across the countries at a better value. It need not be organic only. we do not have weather proof warehousing to store food grains, which are eaten by rodents and spoilt by rains etc so only when we are going to have the back end support like cold storage and infrastructure in place we will have stable profitable farmers here.

He never thinks for value addition to the agricultural produce. For example nowadays eating habits of the Indians have changed, and a number of ready to eat and ready to cook industries are coming up in large scale. All these products need dried fruits and vegetables but the farmers never think about this. For example I have a very good project called dry storage which means as the farmer preserve his produce in cold storage, it could be stored in dried form. The process of drying also could be carried out by using waste heat energy of cold storage which is normally released in the atmosphere. This could be one of its kind and a very good green project for farmers. Ensemble Systems Esha Garden C 601, D.P.

This is what happening with the cymbidium in this region. Most of the farmers growing organic agro product but they have no certifications but the selling must have to guarantee the food safety because those products are prefer by the local market. So those product should me promoted in a special way. Small scale production or the small cluster of farmers with small pieces of land. Lack of knowledge for commercial agro product and Market. Rely on the cultivation of product which are grown by their forefather weather they are commercially demanded or not.
