Go to the shop V N Hydroponic Farm – Soil less farming Home V N Hydroponic Farm – Soil less farming Grows vegetables in soil free mode using coir and organic media Mr. Sai Shankar, founder of V N Hydroponic Farm, recollects using his ‘residence rooftop’ as ‘soilless farm’ for the first time. “I learnt on my own interest and tried several ways; the internet helped me and it’s still helping,” he shares. Presently he has about 32 acres of land of which 16 acres hold mango, coconut, teak and mahogany plantations. “Rest of the portions is under development specifically for the purpose of vegetable plant cultivation,” he adds. The farm is located 17 kms away from Madhuranthagam district at a village named Periyavelikkadu. The farm land is owned by family and friends but managed solely by Mr Shankar. Vegetables grown on the farm comprise of avarai, brinjal, okra, moringa, hot pepper, gourd, and greens among several others. Ginger plants are grown “under coconut trees in shady area.” There are about 2000 ginger plants. He also plans to grow capsicum in a greenhouse which has been completed recently. The basic soilless media is coir dust of size not less than 3mm. “Nowadays cleaned and low EC (electrical conductivity) coir blocks are available in the market,” informs Mr. Shankar. Added to it are organic manures, cakes of neem, groundnut etc. as per individual requirement to be used in various ratios like 70:30, 60:40, 50:50 etc. The media should be filled in “prepared UV stabilized polythene bags” of desired size to be used as growing bag as per the plant. “The media should contain healthy materials and the carbon nitrogen ratio should be good to enable the plant to take up the fertilizers input,” shares Mr. Shankar. He however advises to take precautions in the usage of fertilizers as it plays a vital role in the growth and yield of the plant. “If a person is unable to find out macro and micronutrient deficiency in a plant then frustration alone will remain at the end,” he clarifies. Mr. Shankar shares his investment saying, “The investment in figure to have weed mat, grow bags, fillers, quality seeds, drip facility, trellis if required, fertilizers, man power etc. will cost around Rs. 7000 minimum for about 15 thousand plants.” The grow bags and weed mat can sustain for a period of about 3-5 years. The usage of weed mat “facilitates me to discard tractor usage, no weeds and no weeders.” The grow bags are kept on top of the weed mat. Speaking of ROI (Return on Investment) Mr. Shankar shares, “On a number of farming basis with good yield and average best selling price, the ROI will be in second or third farming itself.” One farming cycle ranges about 4-10 months. Mr. Shankar shares his experience on green chili cultivation saying he gets a “yield of 7 kilos per plant approximately.” The lifetime of the plant is approximately 10 months. “Depending on the demand I used to get a minimum of INR. 25.00 average per kilo.” Entire farm produce is sold to volume buyers at Chennai Koyembedu market. Mr. Sai Shankar is a postgraduate in Physics. Contact details- V N Hydroponic Farms Ariyanur Road, Periyavelikkadu village, Madhuranthagam district, Tamilnadu.
