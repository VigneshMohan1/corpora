Planting Planting is done in pits of 60 x 60 x 60 cm at a square spacing of 7-8 m. Training and pruning No pruning is necessary; but in old trees, lower branches can be removed up to 1 m height. Flowering and fruiting The tree flowers continuously in several flushes at short intervals throughout the year. But there are two seasons when flowers will be produced profusely i.e., October to November and February to March. Grafted sapota begins to bear in the third year after planting. Fruit production increases with age up to 30 years followed by a decline. Fruits mature about 4 months after flowering. Top...
