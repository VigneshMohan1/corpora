Also promotes new mango variety Imampasand Is it possible to grow 675-750 mango trees in one acre farmland? Sounds impossible!! Professional Agro Farm Development, a consultancy firm, has developed a unique technique to make it practically possible to grow more tress in less space. Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram, Director of the company refers to the technique as ultra-intensity mango plantation. He explains, “Normally only 100 or 120 plants are planted in one acre but through this technique, maintaining 3 meter by 2 meter distance we can grow 750 mango plants per acre approximately just like banana.” Easy maintenance and tree starting to yield within 3 years are the two main advantages of the technique. “Short variety of mango plants of about 6 feet height and 4 feet width is used which in turn helps the farmer to maintain them easily for spraying and plucking the fruits etc. The quantity of yield is very much higher than the normal mango plantation method. This method of planting is popular in foreign countries, and recently we have developed it in our country also,” shares Mr. Sundaram. There are many mango varieties that can be grown using high intensity mango plantation method. “Alphonso and other varieties are popular everywhere, but recently we have developed ‘Imampasand’ mango variety. It is planted two times a year, and the yield will also be two times per year. Normally with the other varieties, mango yield will be only for one season. The selling price of Imampasand is higher than Alphonsa,” avers Mr. Sundaram. The cost of the plant is minimum Rs.100 per plant in the local area. In Bombay and other areas the selling price of Imampasand mango is Rs. 500/Kg. Both organic and inorganic fertilizers are used. “We are using organic fertilizer like vermi compost, coir pit etc for soil. We are also using water soluble fertilizer. It is 100% soluble, and we are importing it from Israel and Holland. These two countries are very famous for the water soluble fertilizers. These fertilizers help in increasing the yield compared to other fertilizers,” informs Mr. Sundaram. It is practically not possible to turn completely organic as it is very difficult to control the pests in the normal season, and the yield will be less compared to inorganic farming practices. Modern irrigation technology tools such as like multi system and irrigation system are used. He shares, “I am managing 3000 plants from 5 acres using one and half hour of bore well pumping of water. One and a half hour water pumping is sufficient for 3000 plants.” Speaking about intercropping, Mr. Sundaram says that it is possible, but is not recommended because every plant needs different irrigation system and fertilizers that is hard to maintain for intercrops. South Indian states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka are the main areas of operations of the company. Mr. Sundaram is also working on natural pest control method where no pesticides shall be used. He awaits government approval following which he shall share the details. He plans to spread awareness on the method mostly within a year. Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram is an agriculture engineer with 22 years of experience. He completed his B.E (Agriculture) at Coimbatore Agricultural University. At present he is working as an agricultural consultant in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He also worked as a senior executive marketing engineer in Protech Power in Coimbatore.
