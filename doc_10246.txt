It is a family owned farm located at Vadapudupatti, Theni district in Tamil Nadu. The farm has 15000 bamboo trees spread all over. Banana and amla are grown in 15 acres each whereas mango in 10 acres, coconut in 12 acres and cashew in 35 acres of the farmland. Mr. Alwarsamy Chandrasekhar, one of the founder members and MD of the farm says, “Growing more trees contributes largely to produce more oxygen to the environment.” Natural manures are the only farming input used at the farm. He adds, “Natural manure is sufficient for having high yielding and healthy trees, as it does not require any pesticide or soil enrichment substitutes.” It is the only farm having bamboo plantation in the vicinity. Speaking of bamboo farming Mr. Chandrasekaran says, “It gives long life to the farm and assures satisfactory annual income once the market is recognized.” However initially the investment required is high, marketing is difficult, and selling price is low which are a few of the challenges faced. Also there is no after sales support from the bamboo suppliers in rearing the plant and marketing. To set up food processing unit is the plan for the future. Mr. Chandrasekaran would also be looking forward to try some new crops in the vacant 175 acres space at the farm. He is a textile graduate and has 30 years of experience in textile industry from fiber to fashion. Our Correspondent Contact Details:  ACV Products Pvt.
