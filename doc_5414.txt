PRESS NOTE Government is conscious of the fact that a lot of reforms are required in the Public Sector Banks. With a view to crystallize ideas for reforms, recently a two-day Retreat of CMDs of Banks and Financial Institutions called `Gyan Sangam’ was held at Pune on 1st and 2nd January, 2015. This Retreat generated an agenda in which banks themselves were supposed to undertake certain activities individually or jointly and there were certain things which were supposed to be done by the Government. 2. One of the general principle adopted was that efficient banks should be encouraged. For the last few years, Government of India has been infusing capital to those banks whose equity erosion has taken place. This year, the Government of India has a new criteria in which the banks which are more efficient would only be rewarded with extra capital for their equity so that they can further strengthen their position. Out of the current year’s budget, Government of India has decided to infuse Rs.6990 crores in nine PSBs for which orders are being issued. The methodology for arriving the amount to be infused in these banks has been based on efficiency parameters. First of all, weighted average of return on assets (ROA) for all PSBs for last three years put together was arrived at and all those who were above the average have been considered. 3. The second parameter that has been used is return on equity (ROE) for these banks for the last financial year. Those who have performed better than average have been rewarded. As per these two efficiency criteria, the amount allocated bank-wise is as follows : S.No. Name of the Bank Amount (Rupees in crore) 1 State Bank of India 2970 2 Bank of Baroda 1260 3 Punjab National Bank 870 4 Canara Bank 570 5 Syndicate Bank 460 6 Allahabad Bank 320 7 Indian Bank 280 8 Dena Bank 140 9 Andhra Bank 120 Total 6990
