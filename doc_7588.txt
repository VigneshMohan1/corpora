Host countries The championship is scheduled to be jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand. This is in fact the second time that these two countries will be hosting the world's biggest cricketing event; the first time was in 1992 when Pakistan had won the championship. Both Australia and New Zealand had originally bid to host the World Cup in 2011. Even though the International Cricket Council (ICC) was highly impressed with the considerable merits of the bid, the hosting rights was ultimately granted to the Asian block as they had won the bid by seven votes to four. However, the efficiency of the Trans-Tasman bid was such that it won them an opportunity to host the next World cup (2015). Format The ICC annual conference held in Hong Kong in June 2011 decided that a total of 14 teams will be scheduled to play in World Cup 2015. The 10 test playing nations of ICC are automatically qualified to play in the tournament. The associate and the affiliate members of the ICC will play ICC Cricket World Cup qualifying programme and top four teams? amongst these will get to participate in the Mega event. The format for playing the games remains the same as in 2011. The fourteen teams taking part in the competition will be divided into two groups of seven who will play against each other until the top four teams from each group qualify for the quarter finals. The formatting of the tournament has been done in such a way that each team gets to play a minimum of six matches even if they exit the group stage.

In fact, England has hosted the cricket World cup four times, but does not have a single World cup title in its name despite reaching the finals thrice. The organizers of ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 have retained the same venues as in 1992 for hosting the two semi-finals and the finals. The semifinals will be played in the SCG in Sydney and Eden Park in Auckland, and the finals will be held in the MCG in Melbourne where a crowd of nearly 87,000 people watched Pakistan win their first ever world cup in 1992. Christchurch, the city devastated by an earthquake in 2011, will host the inaugural match between New Zealand and Sri Lanka on 14th of February. India will play its first match against arch rival Pakistan in Adelaide the next day. Interestingly, India has never lost to Pakistan in any of the World cup matches so far. A total of 49 matches will be played in 44 days across 14 cities with Australia staging 26 matches and New Zealand 23 matches. Among the four qualifying teams for World cup 2015, Ireland has already qualified as a result of a tied match against Netherlands that was held on 9th July 2013.
