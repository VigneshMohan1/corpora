Specializes in eucalyptus clones Sai Lasya Hi-Tech Nursery was set up in 2005 with certain objectives to accomplish. Some of them included meeting farmers’ demands, supplying plants at lower cost, uplifting people above poverty line, improving greenery and controlling pollution. Mr. Sanjeeva Rao M is the proprietor of the nursery that spreads over 6 acres. The annual turnover is Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs. Standing true to its name, the nursery has hitech features such as mist chambers, hardening chambers, and sprinkler system for watering. The nursery produces clones of eucalyptus, teak, red sanders, bamboo and rose wood. Other plants it supplies are avenue and ornamental plants, alistonia svhalaris, teabubia rosia, switenia macrophylla, mimosopsis elagi, bauhinia blackiana, anthrocephalus cadamba, pterocarpus sanilinus and dalbrgialatifolia. Mr. Rao adds that the demand for eucalyptus clones is good. Sai Lasya’s customers include farmers, marginal land lords, government organizations, NGOs and forest departments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Awareness on plants and services offered by the nursery is created by supplying quality seedlings to progressive farmers. Satisfied farmers then spread their experiences with Sai Lasya to others in the village and neighboring villages as well. The nursery also has a website to shed more light on their works to those interested. It makes sure that quality is maintained at its best to retain customer confidence and the nursery’s reputation. So far, the nursery has supplied 20 lakhs eucalyptus clones of high yielding variety. Adding more about eucalyptus trees, Mr. Rao says, “It is a quick growing species and can be harvested within 4 to 5 years, and you can take crop of minimum 3 rotations so that capital investment can be reduced. Except saline soils this can be grown in all soils, right from sea level to higher altitudes”. A revenue of Rs. 1,35,000/ per acre in 4 years can be expected from eucalyptus. He also recommends farmers with 10 acres of land to grow quick growing species like eucalyptus clones, casuarina, or kubabul in at least 5 acres of land. This will assure a revenue of Rs. 5 to 6 lakhs at the end of the fourth year. The farmer can thus sustain even if other crops fetch him losses. Mr. Sanjeeva Rao M holds a master’s degree in Botany from Sardar Patel University. He was later recruited in forest department of Andhra Pradesh as a Forest Range Officer. He set up the nursery after his retirement in an attempt to keep himself busy while also providing employment to nearby villagers.
