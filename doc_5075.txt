Over 60% of the population in India relies on agriculture as a means of livelihood. And despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, agriculture is still the largest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall socio-economic development of India. In recent times however, increasing debt and declining returns have led many farmers across the country to extreme impoverishment. Given the lack of access to modern scientific farming techniques, experts and markets, farmers are forced to depend on their past experience and intuition, leading to further adversity. Thus far, the dominant modes of this knowledge gap has been fulfilled by mass communication technologies like the television and radio broadcast programs that, unfortunately, provide general information rather than addressing the specific needs of individual farmers. The current extension service delivered through trained officers at the local level is also limited. Most of the agricultural advice is generic to block-levels and rarely deals with plot level advice concerning the requirements of individual farmers. Farmers are also ill equipped to deal with changing market trends and opportunities and hence do not find agriculture as efficient or remunerative. Therefore there is strong need to align the needs of farmers, their existing experience and knowledge base with modern agricultural trends and practices. One of the reasons for such a situation is understood to be the information gap and inability of a farmer (especially small and medium farmers) to handle modern markets and the modern financial system. They must therefore be equipped with the following information in order to improve both the productivity and profitability of their agricultural yield. What to grow? Appropriate Input selection Focused advice during Growth phase Harvesting time and technique Where to sell? This project is aimed at building inexpensive tools and techniques (technologies), which can be used to bridge some of the above Information gaps. It is recognized that bridging Information gaps is not a panacea to all the problems of Indian agriculture. The problems are many and complex. Nor is the belief that the technologies developed here would be enough to take care of the Information gaps described here. They would, however, be useful and inexpensive tools that have the potential to take India�s agricultural extension and advisory system to a new dimension. The project however does not limit itself to building tools alone. Extensive User trials of these tools in the field are important to check their veracity. Furthermore, tool building itself is a process, and design iterations will be necessary depending upon feedback from the field. Therefore a reasonable scale extension is an integral part of the project.
