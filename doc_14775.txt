IOGOOS identified Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) as the coordinating and implementing agency. The aim of the project is to provide ocean colour data products to users at near real-time (NRT) meant for research as well as operational activities such as potential fishing zone (PFZ advisories). The Ocean Colour Application Team (OCAT) at INCOIS has setup an Automatic Data Processing Chain (ADPC) for acquisition, processing and dissemination of ocean colour data products from MODIS-Aqua. The standard data products that are being disseminated presently are: chlorophyll (CHL), diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (Kd490), aerosol optical thickness at 869 nm (AOT), sea surface temperature (SST) and quasi-true colour composites (BRS). The value-added services include: total suspended matter (TSM), bloom indices (BI), rolled data products, and rolling anomaly in CHL and SST. These standard and value added products from MODIS-Aqua are being provided at NRT to IOGOOS Member States: India, Sri Lanka, Iran, Kenya, Maldives, Oman, Tanzania and Thailand. Standard Products             Value Added Products Acknowledgement The OCAT at INCOIS humbly acknowledges NASA GSFC for making available MODIS-Aqua data for research purpose.
