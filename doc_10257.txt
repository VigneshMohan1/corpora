Located at Udaipur, Rajashtan Amrit Sanjeevani was established by Mr. Shivam Patel in 2007. The desire to provide good quality material and good consultancy to people who were not well-versed with organic farming led to the emergence of the company. It is currently into stevia, aloevera and amla products. It has about 76 varieties of products such as aloevera health, amla health care and skin care products. All products are made in the company’s own production unit. The company also provides consultancy on organic farming. It owns an aloevera farm of 50 acres in Rajasthan. Other produces are obtained through buy-back agreements. All facilities from the beginning to harvest are provided by the company. The annual turnover is around Rs. 3 crores. The company holds certifications from Trust Me, ISO, GMP and Getit. It has also won the business award for 2012-2013. “Everybody wants good quality products. Since herbal products are in demand, I think everybody can use our products,” says Ms. Saroj Patel, Director of Amrit Sanjeevani. Among medicinal plants, the company deals with Stevia, aloevera, neem and safed musli. Speaking of challenges faced in medicinal plant cultivation Ms. Saroj says, “people who are not able to succeed in farming and businessmen having no knowledge about medicinal plants are our main challenges”. Though finding buyers for medicinal plants is difficult, creating demand has not been a major issue for the company as it has a production unit of its own. Stevia and neem are more in demand in the market currently. The company has researched on the new stevia variety for farmers to get 12% more stevia site. Ms. Saroj is of the opinion that export of medicinal plants is more profitable than its sale within the country. “Now we supply within India but we are planning for exports very soon,” she shares. The company wishes to carve its name among the top ten companies of India in the future. Ms. Saroj is an M.Com. Apart from Amrit Sanjeevani, social work keeps her busy.
