Your shopping bag is empty. Go to the shop Om Farms & Nursery Home Om Farms & Nursery Nursery located on the Mumbai-Pune Highway in Vadgaon Maval. The nursery has a wide range in seasonals, perennials, ornamentals, all kinds of fruit plants, avenue trees, forest, medicinal plants and a wide range of grasses and turfs. It also has a garden center at the nursery where people can get all kinds of tools and implements, as well as seeds and bio fertilizers. The farm’s production centre is located on the banks of the river Indrayani and is at present spread on an area of 20 acres, which is being expanded to around 50 acres in the near future. Mr. Ashok Gupta, who owns the farm says, “We have around 2 acres of net house, 20,000 sq. ft. of polyhouse and the rest in open field.” Variety of Plants The main plants the farm cultivates are hibiscus, roses, around 300 varieties of hedging, creepers besides others. When asked about the new plants in sale at present in Om Farms, Mr. Gupta says, “It’s a huge list but the current favourites are seasonals like petunias, antirinums, begonias, marigolds and lotus.” Adding, “As a rule we don’t do bonsais as to me its torturing a plant. We produce around 7000 plants daily.” Talking about the speciality of his nursery, Mr. Gupta says, “The uniqueness of our farm is the number of varieties under one roof and of course the quality, too. The health and vigour of our saplings is class apart, which is a result of constant monitoring and a genuine feeling for plants.” Marketing The farm sells the plants from the farms itself. “We also participate in few exihibitions. We haven’t thought of exporting,” says Mr. Gutpa. “Most of our customers are small nursery men and landscapers,” he adds. The farm has also ventured into landscaping recently. “We executed a job for L&T recently,” he reveals. Without disclosing the amount invested in the business, Mr. Gupta says, “We did not receive any subsidy.” He maintains that he did not use the services of any consultant to set up the nursery business, either. Infrastructure The farm employs around 125 people and has a turnover of Rs.12 million. Mr. Gupta claims that the farm has more than a 1000 variety of plants. The farm grows 95 per cent of the plants in-house. “We get a few varieties of palm from outside, which we plan to start growing soon,” he avers. Mr. Gupta says that land is not so costly in the area he has his farm. “I own some land while the rest is on lease,” he says. He suggests marigolds for commercial agriculture/horticulture to farmers for greater profits. Mr. Gupta has been in the field of construction for the last 20 years. “That was my sole business. But 4 years ago when I was in a position for diversification I thought of several lines but chose agriculture for several reasons,” he says, adding, “If you see our ancient scriptures, our ancestors chose agriculture over industry and technology, which made me think. I took a fresh and positive look at agri business and reached to the following conclusions: you sow 1 seed and in a time ranging from a few months to a few years it multiplies in thousands, no other investment multiplies that fast; you are always with mother nature and as everybody would agree it’s soothing; serving the society by providing plants at reasonable rate. All these reasons were motivation enough forme to plunge into his business.” He further adds, “I would like to say that there is a misconception that there is no money in this field. I want to tell the farmers and entrepreneurs that there is great potential and there are many areas still uncovered. Plants are something which everyone loves be it fruits, vegetables or flowers. So I would once again reiterate that there is huge potential.” Our Correspondent Subarnarekha Agri Services Promoting dairy in Haryana Search – articles Questions Wanted For Sale Discussion Forum Articles Members Directory Banner Ads Online Store You are here: AgricultureInformation.com > ARTICLES > Om Farms & Nursery Related – articles, consultants, downloads Sri Lakshmivenkateshwara Nursery Ankur Nursery Perikali Trading Company – nursery and landscaping services SK Organic Farms – online sales You can also post your message via missed call 0888 0884 000 (India) PRINTED MAGAZINE AVAILABLE Get a summary of articles and messages posted on this website in the form of easy to read printed magazine.
