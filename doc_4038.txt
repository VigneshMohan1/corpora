The Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering at OSU treats each person seeking an advanced degree as an individual, and everyone is encouraged to develop a program of study based on his or her personal and professional goals. Two degrees are offered: Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering. We have four general areas for study: Biomechanical Systems, Bioprocessing and Biotechnology, Environmental and Natural Resources, and Food Processing. None of the Department’s degrees have a set curriculum requirement. Students work with their advisor to develop a plan of study that includes courses from engineering, mathematics, computer science, statistics, agriculture and related disciplines that will suit their particular needs and interests. Individual research is the most important element in our graduate program. It allows students to develop a close working relationship with the faculty, a hallmark of our program. We pride ourselves on our excellent research labs. Graduates of the Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering program at OSU find a variety of jobs in universities, private companies and government agencies. Our graduates can be found in almost every state in the United States and many foreign countries.
