Contents 1 Individually setting/removing entries 2 Template-protected edit request on 12 December 2014 3 Template-protected edit request on 17 March 2015 4 Template-protected edit request on 31 March 2015 5 Template-protected edit request on 18 April 2015 6 Sovereign states Individually setting/removing entries [ edit ] @ Codename Lisa : Instead of using parser functions to alter the link for Macau for for a specific topic within this general template, would it be a better idea to add the functionality in {{ Europe topic }} of individually changing or removing links to the other continent-topic templates as well? That way the link to Macau can be easily changed within {{ Capitals in Asia }} instead of here. SiBr 4 ( talk ) 10:30, 30 August 2014 (UTC) Hi. I don't know. I am not active in this area, so I wouldn't know whether doing this is a waste of time and rendering performance or actually useful. For time being, I assume it safe to say implementing it for Macau alone would be nice. Best regards, Codename Lisa ( talk ) 01:08, 31 August 2014 (UTC) It just seems odd to me that the Europe template has several options that not all of the other continents have – the country-specific parameters, the |image= parameter (shared with the Asia template) and the |article= parameter. Adding these options to all templates would make them consistent. SiBr 4 ( talk ) 20:41, 31 August 2014 (UTC) I think this is a good idea. If you have the time to sandbox and test these changes, I will happily deploy. — Martin ( MSGJ  ·  talk ) 10:44, 26 September 2014 (UTC) @ MSGJ : After quite a lot of testing, I have now made the change, updated transcluding articles and templates that would otherwise break and added documentation. I'll do the remaining continents later. SiBr 4 ( talk ) 19:37, 27 September 2014 (UTC) Template-protected edit request on 12 December 2014 [ edit ] This edit request has been answered. Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. Kindly remove Egypt from the list as it isn't an Asian country. Jon Jonathan ( talk ) 18:18, 12 December 2014 (UTC) Please see two previous sections on this page, which explain why it is. SiBr 4 ( talk ) 18:59, 12 December 2014 (UTC) Template-protected edit request on 17 March 2015 [ edit ] This edit request has been answered. Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. Add LGBT rights in ISIL controlled territory to "states with limited recognition". The article is well sourced and covers the situation of LGBT people in a state with limited recognition. 3hunna ( talk ) 22:03, 17 March 2015 (UTC) 3hunna ( talk ) 22:03, 17 March 2015 (UTC) Not done , that article is not a state with limited recognition so does not belong in a list of states. — xaosflux Talk 03:06, 18 March 2015 (UTC) Template-protected edit request on 31 March 2015 [ edit ] This edit request has been answered. Set the |answered= or |ans= parameter to no to reactivate your request. Please remove "Russia" from the list of Asian countries, and leave it where it belongs in the European section. Likewise, please remove "Turkey" from the list of European countries, and leave it in the Asian section. Thank you. 209.210.220.64 ( talk ) 17:58, 31 March 2015 (UTC) Not done: please establish a consensus for this alteration before using the {{ edit template-protected }} template. This change would obviously be controversial, so I'm disabling the request.

Thanks In the Petroleum in Asia template. Merchant of Asia ( talk ) 00:18, 18 April 2015 (UTC) Not sure what you're asking for. Do you want a new navbox created? Alakzi ( talk ) 00:36, 18 April 2015 (UTC) I'm not sure why a petroleum template redirects here. The one at the bottom of this page . Can't edit it.-- Merchant of Asia ( talk ) 00:43, 18 April 2015 (UTC) The way this navbox works is by prefixing a string of words in front of a country name. The easiest thing to do would be to create redirects from Petroleum industry in Burma and Petroleum industry in Bangladesh . Alakzi ( talk ) 00:50, 18 April 2015 (UTC) Thanks again.-- Merchant of Asia ( talk ) 01:05, 18 April 2015 (UTC) Sovereign states [ edit ] Can anyone change this into " UN members"? This can make sure there are less disbutes. -- Owennson ( talk ) 07:50, 26 May 2015 (UTC) I'm not too sure about changing the header of the first group from "sovereign states" to "UN members" in the continent-topic templates ( 1 2 3 4 ). Vatican City is now listed as a UN member in Template:Europe topic , which it isn't . SiBr 4 ( talk ) 15:43, 26 May 2015 (UTC) @ Owennson : I have reverted your changes to these templates. Please be sure to establish consensus before changing such widely used templates. I like your idea of reducing the disputes about which countries may be sovereign or not, but unilateral changes are probably going to cause an equal amount of drama. And there are other things that need to be considered: e.g. the status of the Vatican, or the general structure of these templates. If we have a list of UN members, how does the section of "states with limited recognition" and "dependencies" fit into it? A logical sorting would be "UN members" vs "Non-UN-members".
