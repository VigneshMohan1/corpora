Located at Gopalpur, Maharashtra Kirtisingh Rana Akhrani Farm was set up in 1998. It is a mango orchard farm spread over an area over 60 acres with 2360 mango trees. Mr. Kirtisingh Rana is the owner of the farm. It is located in Gopalpur, Maharashtra. Speaking about the objective behind establishing the mango orchard, Mr. Rana says, “I had a number of varieties of mango trees in my 3 acre compound which were planted by my father in 1965 and I found that the Kesar variety suited the soil and climatic conditions of the area. It gave me the incentive to go for a large orchard in a commercial scale.” Funding Mr. Rana took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from the State Bank of India and received another Rs. 2 lakhs from the state government as grant and incentive to set up the orchard. “Besides I invested over Rs. 2 lakhs of my own. Initially the expenses were high because I had to install barbed wire fencing around the 60 acres and also put in the drip irrigation,” informs Mr. Rana. Mango Variety Grown The orchard primarily grows kesar variety of mango. He also has alphonso, totapuri, and rajapuri. “But out of 2360 trees, I have around 2200 of kesar. During the last season I had a yield of over 2000 quintals and gave the orchard on contract for Rs 31 lakhs,” maintains Mr. Rana. Sourcing and Planting Mr. Rana sourced the kesar mango saplings from Valsad, Gujarat. “Initially I planted 40 trees per acre, which is necessary as the soil is rich and the trees mature faster here than in other places. For the first 2 years I gave the plants organic manure and made sure that that they had plenty of water, especially in summer because the mortality was highest during those first few years,” he says. Farming Methodology The spacing between the saplings is 10 by 10 meters and the pits are 2 feet deep and 2 feet wide. “Drip irrigation is essential for the first few years. It is imperative to fence the orchard so that cattle do not enter and destroy the saplings. It is also necessary to test the soil to be aware if it is conducive for fruit trees, especially mango trees in that area,” he adds. Besides drip irrigation, the orchard has a couple of bore wells and a dam nearby. Mr. Rana has been planting soya bean as inter crop with mango for the kharif crop and gram for the rabi crop. “Both the crops, besides giving you a yield, also give nutrients to the soil. I have now stopped taking any intercrops because the trees are now over 20 feet high and 15 feet wide,” he says. When asked if the farm implemented eco-friendly or chemicals for the ripening process, Mr. Rana maintains, “I usually give the whole orchard on contract so the person concerned uses his own methods or sends the raw mangoes to the exports market.” Further speaking about the manure/fertilizer use at the orchard, Mr. Rana says, “I am fortunate that we have dams in our area so when they dry up in summer I spread the silt from the dam around the tree trunk. I also use cattle manure and compost when available. At present I have still not used chemical fertilizers though I have started using chemical pesticides to control the pests during the winter.” Target Customers The farm sells to wholesalers exporters in the Vashi market in Mumbai through their agent. “If I strike a good deal then I sell it directly to the wholesaler,” says Mr. Rana. Farming and Marketing Challenges Speaking about the challenges faced in the farm, Mr. Rana says, “We face labor problems because our labors migrate to Gujarat during the winters. Since I have now started giving the orchard on contract, the person concerned gets his laborers and manages the harvest period. The advantage of my orchard is that the fruit is ready almost a month before any other orchard of the Kesar variety.” “Others challenges included a drought period when I had to water the plants using a tanker. That year mortality was high. A couple of years the pests ate up all the leaves of the trees and I did not get any fruits because we did not use the pesticides on time,” says Mr. Rana. Mr. Rana was awarded the Udhyan Pandit award by the Maharashtra government for his contribution to horticulture. He says, “It is my goal to see that farmers are motivated by my success story and make an effort to diversify into horticulture because it would also help having a green cover in our area.” Mr. Rana is a BA, LLB by educational qualification.
