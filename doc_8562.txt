Any contributions made towards Access Agriculture will be named with a credit acknowledging the link, and in some cases a sponsorship opportunity with links to further interesting websites. Any contribution will be acknowledged and will go towards a fund established by Access Agriculture to pay for new language versions of programmes based on demand in different countries. There are opportunities to help support participants for training and for production and distribution of DVDs to the end user. Sponsorship on the website may be possible, together with in-kind contributions based on professional skills, expertise and services.
